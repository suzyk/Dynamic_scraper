<strong>👉 Please reference you found the job on Remote OK, this helps us get more companies to post here, thanks!</strong><br><br>
When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.

<div class="markdown">\nAbout Status\nStatus is building the tools and infrastructure for the advancement of a secure, private, and open web3. \nWith the high level goals of preserving the right to privacy, mitigating the risk of censorship, and promoting economic trade in a transparent, open manner, Status is building a community where anyone is welcome to join and contribute.\nAs an organization, Status seeks to push the web3 ecosystem forward through research, creation of developer tools, and support of the open source community. \nAs a product, Status is an open source, Ethereum-based app that gives users the power to chat, transact, and access a revolutionary world of Apps on the decentralized web. But Status is also building foundational infrastructure for the whole Ethereum ecosystem, including the Nimbus ETH 1.0 and 2.0 clients, the Keycard hardware wallet, and the Waku messaging protocol, the p2p communication layer for Web3.\nAs a team, Status has been completely distributed since inception. Our team is currently 200+ core contributors strong, and welcomes a growing number of community members from all walks of life, scattered all around the globe. \nWe care deeply about open source, and our organizational structure has minimal hierarchy and no fixed work hours. We believe in working with a high degree of autonomy while supporting the organization's priorities.\n\n\n\n\nThe role\n\nDevOps is a buzzword, but it's also generic enough to encompass the breadth of tasks required in supporting development teams. There are many ways to make the lives of developers easier, and everyone has their own best way, which also means every team has their own way. There is no perfect way to make everyone happy with the same thing.\n\nSupporting developers involves debugging obscure bash scripts from years ago that nobody remembers. It means biting on a piece of wood and using data formats turned programming languages like YAML to configure CI jobs. It means tracking down minute differences between releases of packages and libraries causing unexpected crashes. It means rewriting the same Dockerfile for the 5th time to allow a project to use one more obscure library. Or tracking down absurd race conditions of multi-threaded tests running in parallel on the same host. Or pulling your hair out at a bug only to realize it works fine after the CI worker host is restarted.\n\nBut fundamentally it means wrestling it all into submission and making it run smoothly... at least for as long as you're there.\n\nIf you have the guts to fight against entropy and deterioration of the reality we inhabit, then you just might also be crazy enough to enjoy the struggle while it lasts, and appreciate the eventual fruits of our labour, if you value privacy, freedom, and transparency. You might even make some money, and learn a bit from all the exceptional engineers working here.\n\n \n\nWho you are\n\nYou have strong Linux Fundamentals:\n\n\n* Distros and package managers\n\n* Good understanding of process management\n\n\n\n\nYou have programming experience:\n\n\n* At least a few languages and showing the ability to learn\n\n* Bash as a minimum; Python would be helpful \n\n\n\n\nYou have experience in Continuous Integration:\n\n\n* Jenkins CI - Pipelines are written in Groovy\n\n* GitHub Actions - PR builds, mostly\n\n\n\n\nYou have experience in Security:\n\n\n* Good understanding of OpenSSH\n\n* GnuPG for encryption of secrets and backups\n\n\n\n\nDistributed Systems:\n\n\n* Experience running Ethereum nodes\n\n* Knowledge of Layer 2 scaling solutions\n\n\n\n\n \n\nCompensation\n\nWe are happy to pay in any mix of fiat/crypto.\n\n \n\nHiring process\n\n* Interview with the Talent team\n\n* Paid task\n\n* Technical interview with Head of Infra\n\n\n\n[The steps may change along the way if we see it makes sense to adapt the interview stages, so please consider the above as a guideline]\n\n\n\n \n \n\n#Salary and compensation\n
No salary data published by company so we estimated salary based on similar jobs related to Web3, Python, DevOps, Senior and Engineer jobs that are similar:\n\n
$60,000 — $110,000/year\n

<strong>👉 Please reference you found the job on Remote OK, this helps us get more companies to post here, thanks!</strong><br><br>
When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.

<strong>👉 Please reference you found the job on Remote OK, this helps us get more companies to post here, thanks!</strong><br><br>
When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.

When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>.

When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site.

When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>.

When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name.

<strong>👉 Please reference you found the job on Remote OK, this helps us get more companies to post here, thanks!</strong><br><br>
When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.

When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site.

<div class="markdown">\nSenior Data Analyst\nRemote\nFull-Time/Regular, Exempt\n#LI-Remote\n\n\nWho We Are:\nGetaround is the world’s first connected carsharing marketplace. Launched in 2011, Getaround is available today in more than 1,000 cities across the United States and Europe.\n\n\nWe connect safe, convenient, and affordable cars with people who need them to live and work via our peer-to-peer marketplace. Our proprietary connected car technology allows guests to book and unlock a wide variety of vehicles directly from our app without ever having to meet anyone in person, carry an access card, wait in line, or coordinate picking up keys, unlike traditional rental car services.\n\n\nGetaround is focused on providing economic opportunities to local communities. Our community includes guests who rely on our cars for on-demand mobility and entrepreneurial hosts (car owners) who share cars on our platform including those who operate their own carsharing businesses.&nbsp;\n\n\nDid you know cars are parked 22 hours a day on average? When we share cars, we don’t need as many on the road, which means fewer accidents, reduced traffic, and less space required for parking. Carsharing modernizes mobility by allowing people to connect multiple forms of efficient transportation for any type of use case.\n\n\nThrough carsharing, we aim to lessen greenhouse gasses and reduce pollution. Studies show that when carsharing is available, people drive less and drive vehicles more appropriate for their use case, which can reduce household carbon emissions by up to 40%. Also, shared cars are used more frequently and retired more quickly, accelerating the adoption of newer, more energy-efficient vehicles.\n\n\nOur mission is to empower people to carshare everywhere by enabling the shift away from car ownership, want to join us?\n\n\nYour Mission:\nGetaround is seeking a seasoned Data Analyst to join our team at Getaround.

<strong>👉 Please reference you found the job on Remote OK, this helps us get more companies to post here, thanks!</strong><br><br>
When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.

												<strong>👉 Please reference you found the job on Remote OK, this helps us get more companies to post here, thanks!</strong><br><br>
												When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.

Your duties will include the development, testing, and maintenance of our serving and data platforms, using a combination of cloud products, open source tools and internal applications.

We are team-first here at Sezzle.&nbsp;\n\n* A hard-working mentality. It’s early and there is still a lot to build.&nbsp;\n\n* An excellent communicator.&nbsp;\n\n* A fun attitude. Life’s too short. We can have fun while we work hard on cool things.&nbsp;\n\n* Smarts. We need people that are smart enough to make decisions on their own and also smart enough to know when they need input from others.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\nCompensation\n\nThe compensation range for the role is as follows:\n\n4,600 - 9,000 USD Monthly\n\nEqual Employment Opportunity: Sezzle Inc. is an equal opportunity employer.

												<strong>👉 Please reference you found the job on Remote OK, this helps us get more companies to post here, thanks!</strong><br><br>
												When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.

												<strong>👉 Please reference you found the job on Remote OK, this helps us get more companies to post here, thanks!</strong><br><br>
												When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.

But Status is also building foundational infrastructure for the whole Ethereum ecosystem, including the Nimbus ETH 1.0 and 2.0 clients, the Keycard hardware wallet, and the Waku messaging protocol, the p2p communication layer for Web3.\nAs a team, Status has been completely distributed since inception. Our team is currently 200+ core contributors strong, and welcomes a growing number of community members from all walks of life, scattered all around the globe. \nWe care deeply about open source, and our organizational structure has minimal hierarchy and no fixed work hours. We believe in working with a high degree of autonomy while supporting the organization's priorities.\n\n\n\n\nThe role\n\nDevOps is a buzzword, but it's also generic enough to encompass the breadth of tasks required in supporting development teams. There are many ways to make the lives of developers easier, and everyone has their own best way, which also means every team has their own way. There is no perfect way to make everyone happy with the same thing.\n\nSupporting developers involves debugging obscure bash scripts from years ago that nobody remembers. It means biting on a piece of wood and using data formats turned programming languages like YAML to configure CI jobs. It means tracking down minute differences between releases of packages and libraries causing unexpected crashes. It means rewriting the same Dockerfile for the 5th time to allow a project to use one more obscure library. Or tracking down absurd race conditions of multi-threaded tests running in parallel on the same host. Or pulling your hair out at a bug only to realize it works fine after the CI worker host is restarted.\n\nBut fundamentally it means wrestling it all into submission and making it run smoothly... at least for as long as you're there.\n\nIf you have the guts to fight against entropy and deterioration of the reality we inhabit, then you just might also be crazy enough to enjoy the struggle while it lasts, and appreciate the eventual fruits of our labour, if you value privacy, freedom, and transparency. You might even make some money, and learn a bit from all the exceptional engineers working here.\n\n \n\nWho you are\n\nYou have strong Linux Fundamentals:\n\n\n* Distros and package managers\n\n* Good understanding of process management\n\n\n\n\nYou have programming experience:\n\n\n* At least a few languages and showing the ability to learn\n\n* Bash as a minimum; Python would be helpful \n\n\n\n\nYou have experience in Continuous Integration:\n\n\n* Jenkins CI - Pipelines are written in Groovy\n\n* GitHub Actions - PR builds, mostly\n\n\n\n\nYou have experience in Security:\n\n\n* Good understanding of OpenSSH\n\n* GnuPG for encryption of secrets and backups\n\n\n\n\nDistributed Systems:\n\n\n* Experience running Ethereum nodes\n\n* Knowledge of Layer 2 scaling solutions\n\n\n\n\n \n\nCompensation\n\nWe are happy to pay in any mix of fiat/crypto.\n\n \n\nHiring process\n\n* Interview with the Talent team\n\n* Paid task\n\n* Technical interview with Head of Infra\n\n\n\n[The steps may change along the way if we see it makes sense to adapt the interview stages, so please consider the above as a guideline]\n\n\n\n \n																																																										\n\n#Salary and compensation\n

												<strong>👉 Please reference you found the job on Remote OK, this helps us get more companies to post here, thanks!</strong><br><br>
												When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.

												When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>.

<strong>👉 Please reference you found the job on Remote OK, this helps us get more companies to post here, thanks!</strong><br><br>
When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.

<div class="markdown">\nAbout Status\nStatus is building the tools and infrastructure for the advancement of a secure, private, and open web3. \nWith the high level goals of preserving the right to privacy, mitigating the risk of censorship, and promoting economic trade in a transparent, open manner, Status is building a community where anyone is welcome to join and contribute.\nAs an organization, Status seeks to push the web3 ecosystem forward through research, creation of developer tools, and support of the open source community. \nAs a product, Status is an open source, Ethereum-based app that gives users the power to chat, transact, and access a revolutionary world of Apps on the decentralized web. But Status is also building foundational infrastructure for the whole Ethereum ecosystem, including the Nimbus ETH 1.0 and 2.0 clients, the Keycard hardware wallet, and the Waku messaging protocol, the p2p communication layer for Web3.\nAs a team, Status has been completely distributed since inception. Our team is currently 200+ core contributors strong, and welcomes a growing number of community members from all walks of life, scattered all around the globe. \nWe care deeply about open source, and our organizational structure has minimal hierarchy and no fixed work hours. We believe in working with a high degree of autonomy while supporting the organization's priorities.\n\n\n\n\nThe role\n\nDevOps is a buzzword, but it's also generic enough to encompass the breadth of tasks required in supporting development teams. There are many ways to make the lives of developers easier, and everyone has their own best way, which also means every team has their own way. There is no perfect way to make everyone happy with the same thing.\n\nSupporting developers involves debugging obscure bash scripts from years ago that nobody remembers. It means biting on a piece of wood and using data formats turned programming languages like YAML to configure CI jobs. It means tracking down minute differences between releases of packages and libraries causing unexpected crashes. It means rewriting the same Dockerfile for the 5th time to allow a project to use one more obscure library. Or tracking down absurd race conditions of multi-threaded tests running in parallel on the same host. Or pulling your hair out at a bug only to realize it works fine after the CI worker host is restarted.\n\nBut fundamentally it means wrestling it all into submission and making it run smoothly... at least for as long as you're there.\n\nIf you have the guts to fight against entropy and deterioration of the reality we inhabit, then you just might also be crazy enough to enjoy the struggle while it lasts, and appreciate the eventual fruits of our labour, if you value privacy, freedom, and transparency. You might even make some money, and learn a bit from all the exceptional engineers working here.\n\n \n\nWho you are\n\nYou have strong Linux Fundamentals:\n\n\n* Distros and package managers\n\n* Good understanding of process management\n\n\n\n\nYou have programming experience:\n\n\n* At least a few languages and showing the ability to learn\n\n* Bash as a minimum; Python would be helpful \n\n\n\n\nYou have experience in Continuous Integration:\n\n\n* Jenkins CI - Pipelines are written in Groovy\n\n* GitHub Actions - PR builds, mostly\n\n\n\n\nYou have experience in Security:\n\n\n* Good understanding of OpenSSH\n\n* GnuPG for encryption of secrets and backups\n\n\n\n\nDistributed Systems:\n\n\n* Experience running Ethereum nodes\n\n* Knowledge of Layer 2 scaling solutions\n\n\n\n\n \n\nCompensation\n\nWe are happy to pay in any mix of fiat/crypto.\n\n \n\nHiring process\n\n* Interview with the Talent team\n\n* Paid task\n\n* Technical interview with Head of Infra\n\n\n\n[The steps may change along the way if we see it makes sense to adapt the interview stages, so please consider the above as a guideline]\n\n\n\n \n \n\n#Salary and compensation\n
No salary data published by company so we estimated salary based on similar jobs related to Web3, Python, DevOps, Senior and Engineer jobs that are similar:\n\n
$60,000 — $110,000/year\n

When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>.

<strong>👉 Please reference you found the job on Remote OK, this helps us get more companies to post here, thanks!</strong><br><br>
When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.

When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.

<strong>👉 Please reference you found the job on Remote OK, this helps us get more companies to post here, thanks!</strong><br><br>
When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.

You get excited about creating deep insights into various crypto protocols using onchain data and supporting the data with broader qualitative research. You have a natural curiosity and love combing through all available data to help tell the story and inform opinions.\nYou love to build and are excited by the idea of working cross-functionally across Research, Product, and Engineering teams to help present and evolve our data analytics approach for Blockworks internally and for our subscribers. You're at home communicating with our audience via Twitter, podcasts, and other mediums about the state of the crypto industry and where it is moving. Lastly, you thrive in an environment where you can provide input and recommendations for data structure and the future of analytics.What You’ll Do:\nAs our Senior Research Data Analyst, you will be responsible for creating in-depth analytics and dashboards that track the health, profitability, and usership of various protocols and sectors. You'll also partner with our Research Services team to help manage and facilitate the data analytics aspects of client engagements. The outputs of your work will be viewed and consumed by broad audiences inside and outside the crypto industry.\nEvery day will look a little different, but in general, you will do things like:\n\n* \nAnalyze and Build Dashboards: You’ll own the creation and maintenance of new data dashboards forced on L1s, L2s, and popular dApps.\n\n* \nDesign and Craft Sector Data: You’ll aggregate and analyze new and existing data to help form comprehensive sector analytics and dashboards, pioneering actionable insights.\n\n* \nImprove Existing Dashboards: You’ll determine how we display data to improve our existing dashboards and highlight the best metrics for any given protocol.\n\n* \nDevelop Solutions and Manage Client Relationships: You'll work hand-in-hand with the Data Analytics Manager to help design, develop, and manage new data solutions for our services clients.\n\n* \nCollaborate with Protocol Teams: You’ll work directly with the protocol teams to aid in the data collection and analysis process, as well as manage client engagements and relationships.\n\n* \nContinuously Learn and Share Knowledge: You’ll proactively keep up-to-date with evolving themes, protocols, and technologies in the industry and share your learning with the broader Research and Blockworks teams.\n\n\n\nExperimentation is frequent at Blockworks. Comfortability with being uncomfortable is a must.What You’ve Done Before:\nYou have a passion for crypto and a relentless curiosity to grow knowledge base on multiple chains, and experience using various dApps. You have several years of professional work experience and success working with onchain data, and you can't wait to showcase some of your best results. You have demonstrated success showcasing and honing your analytical skills in addition to your technical skills and are always able to inform a point of view after reviewing underlying data. You've got hands-on experience working with onchain data with SQL in Dune, Flipside, or similar data analytics toolkits and a strong understanding of&nbsp;how to interact&nbsp;with data on different chains such as Ethereum (and other EVM chains), Solana, and Cosmos chains.&nbsp;You come with an understanding of smart contracts and how to use various block explorers. You're comfortable leading and managing projects independently and love getting hands-on in complex topics to help break them down and move them forward.It’d Be Great If You’ve Done This:\nMultiple years of experience in a data-heavy role or as a research analyst in crypto, TradFi, or consulting will move you to the top of our list. Having experience using dbt and Python or working in a cloud data warehouse like BigQuery will also set you apart from other candidates. If you have experience being active within a DAO or regularly looking into various governance forums, we also want to hear about it.

When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.

When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>.

When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name.

<strong>👉 Please reference you found the job on Remote OK, this helps us get more companies to post here, thanks!</strong><br><br>
When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site.

When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.

<div class="markdown">\nSenior Data Analyst\nRemote\nFull-Time/Regular, Exempt\n#LI-Remote\n\n\nWho We Are:\nGetaround is the world’s first connected carsharing marketplace. Launched in 2011, Getaround is available today in more than 1,000 cities across the United States and Europe.\n\n\nWe connect safe, convenient, and affordable cars with people who need them to live and work via our peer-to-peer marketplace. Our proprietary connected car technology allows guests to book and unlock a wide variety of vehicles directly from our app without ever having to meet anyone in person, carry an access card, wait in line, or coordinate picking up keys, unlike traditional rental car services.\n\n\nGetaround is focused on providing economic opportunities to local communities. Our community includes guests who rely on our cars for on-demand mobility and entrepreneurial hosts (car owners) who share cars on our platform including those who operate their own carsharing businesses.&nbsp;\n\n\nDid you know cars are parked 22 hours a day on average? When we share cars, we don’t need as many on the road, which means fewer accidents, reduced traffic, and less space required for parking. Carsharing modernizes mobility by allowing people to connect multiple forms of efficient transportation for any type of use case.\n\n\nThrough carsharing, we aim to lessen greenhouse gasses and reduce pollution. Studies show that when carsharing is available, people drive less and drive vehicles more appropriate for their use case, which can reduce household carbon emissions by up to 40%. Also, shared cars are used more frequently and retired more quickly, accelerating the adoption of newer, more energy-efficient vehicles.\n\n\nOur mission is to empower people to carshare everywhere by enabling the shift away from car ownership, want to join us?\n\n\nYour Mission:\nGetaround is seeking a seasoned Data Analyst to join our team at Getaround.

When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.

When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name.

												<strong>👉 Please reference you found the job on Remote OK, this helps us get more companies to post here, thanks!</strong><br><br>
												When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.

We are team-first here at Sezzle.&nbsp;\n\n* A hard-working mentality. It’s early and there is still a lot to build.&nbsp;\n\n* An excellent communicator.&nbsp;\n\n* A fun attitude. Life’s too short. We can have fun while we work hard on cool things.&nbsp;\n\n* Smarts. We need people that are smart enough to make decisions on their own and also smart enough to know when they need input from others.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\nCompensation\n\nThe compensation range for the role is as follows:\n\n4,600 - 9,000 USD Monthly\n\nEqual Employment Opportunity: Sezzle Inc. is an equal opportunity employer.

												When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>.

												<strong>👉 Please reference you found the job on Remote OK, this helps us get more companies to post here, thanks!</strong><br><br>
												When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.

												When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>.

But Status is also building foundational infrastructure for the whole Ethereum ecosystem, including the Nimbus ETH 1.0 and 2.0 clients, the Keycard hardware wallet, and the Waku messaging protocol, the p2p communication layer for Web3.\nAs a team, Status has been completely distributed since inception. Our team is currently 200+ core contributors strong, and welcomes a growing number of community members from all walks of life, scattered all around the globe. \nWe care deeply about open source, and our organizational structure has minimal hierarchy and no fixed work hours. We believe in working with a high degree of autonomy while supporting the organization's priorities.\n\n\n\n\nThe role\n\nDevOps is a buzzword, but it's also generic enough to encompass the breadth of tasks required in supporting development teams. There are many ways to make the lives of developers easier, and everyone has their own best way, which also means every team has their own way. There is no perfect way to make everyone happy with the same thing.\n\nSupporting developers involves debugging obscure bash scripts from years ago that nobody remembers. It means biting on a piece of wood and using data formats turned programming languages like YAML to configure CI jobs. It means tracking down minute differences between releases of packages and libraries causing unexpected crashes. It means rewriting the same Dockerfile for the 5th time to allow a project to use one more obscure library. Or tracking down absurd race conditions of multi-threaded tests running in parallel on the same host. Or pulling your hair out at a bug only to realize it works fine after the CI worker host is restarted.\n\nBut fundamentally it means wrestling it all into submission and making it run smoothly... at least for as long as you're there.\n\nIf you have the guts to fight against entropy and deterioration of the reality we inhabit, then you just might also be crazy enough to enjoy the struggle while it lasts, and appreciate the eventual fruits of our labour, if you value privacy, freedom, and transparency. You might even make some money, and learn a bit from all the exceptional engineers working here.\n\n \n\nWho you are\n\nYou have strong Linux Fundamentals:\n\n\n* Distros and package managers\n\n* Good understanding of process management\n\n\n\n\nYou have programming experience:\n\n\n* At least a few languages and showing the ability to learn\n\n* Bash as a minimum; Python would be helpful \n\n\n\n\nYou have experience in Continuous Integration:\n\n\n* Jenkins CI - Pipelines are written in Groovy\n\n* GitHub Actions - PR builds, mostly\n\n\n\n\nYou have experience in Security:\n\n\n* Good understanding of OpenSSH\n\n* GnuPG for encryption of secrets and backups\n\n\n\n\nDistributed Systems:\n\n\n* Experience running Ethereum nodes\n\n* Knowledge of Layer 2 scaling solutions\n\n\n\n\n \n\nCompensation\n\nWe are happy to pay in any mix of fiat/crypto.\n\n \n\nHiring process\n\n* Interview with the Talent team\n\n* Paid task\n\n* Technical interview with Head of Infra\n\n\n\n[The steps may change along the way if we see it makes sense to adapt the interview stages, so please consider the above as a guideline]\n\n\n\n \n																																																										\n\n#Salary and compensation\n

												When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site.

												<strong>👉 Please reference you found the job on Remote OK, this helps us get more companies to post here, thanks!</strong><br><br>
												When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.

<strong>👉 Please reference you found the job on Remote OK, this helps us get more companies to post here, thanks!</strong><br><br>
When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them.

When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Status SNT is hiring a </span><br>Remote Senior DevOps Engineer </h1>
<div class="markdown">\nAbout Status\nStatus is building the tools and infrastructure for the advancement of a secure, private, and open web3. \nWith the high level goals of preserving the right to privacy, mitigating the risk of censorship, and promoting economic trade in a transparent, open manner, Status is building a community where anyone is welcome to join and contribute.\nAs an organization, Status seeks to push the web3 ecosystem forward through research, creation of developer tools, and support of the open source community. \nAs a product, Status is an open source, Ethereum-based app that gives users the power to chat, transact, and access a revolutionary world of Apps on the decentralized web. But Status is also building foundational infrastructure for the whole Ethereum ecosystem, including the Nimbus ETH 1.0 and 2.0 clients, the Keycard hardware wallet, and the Waku messaging protocol, the p2p communication layer for Web3.\nAs a team, Status has been completely distributed since inception. Our team is currently 200+ core contributors strong, and welcomes a growing number of community members from all walks of life, scattered all around the globe. \nWe care deeply about open source, and our organizational structure has minimal hierarchy and no fixed work hours. We believe in working with a high degree of autonomy while supporting the organization's priorities.\n\n\n\n\nThe role\n\nDevOps is a buzzword, but it's also generic enough to encompass the breadth of tasks required in supporting development teams. There are many ways to make the lives of developers easier, and everyone has their own best way, which also means every team has their own way. There is no perfect way to make everyone happy with the same thing.\n\nSupporting developers involves debugging obscure bash scripts from years ago that nobody remembers. It means biting on a piece of wood and using data formats turned programming languages like YAML to configure CI jobs. It means tracking down minute differences between releases of packages and libraries causing unexpected crashes. It means rewriting the same Dockerfile for the 5th time to allow a project to use one more obscure library. Or tracking down absurd race conditions of multi-threaded tests running in parallel on the same host. Or pulling your hair out at a bug only to realize it works fine after the CI worker host is restarted.\n\nBut fundamentally it means wrestling it all into submission and making it run smoothly... at least for as long as you're there.\n\nIf you have the guts to fight against entropy and deterioration of the reality we inhabit, then you just might also be crazy enough to enjoy the struggle while it lasts, and appreciate the eventual fruits of our labour, if you value privacy, freedom, and transparency. You might even make some money, and learn a bit from all the exceptional engineers working here.\n\n \n\nWho you are\n\nYou have strong Linux Fundamentals:\n\n\n* Distros and package managers\n\n* Good understanding of process management\n\n\n\n\nYou have programming experience:\n\n\n* At least a few languages and showing the ability to learn\n\n* Bash as a minimum; Python would be helpful \n\n\n\n\nYou have experience in Continuous Integration:\n\n\n* Jenkins CI - Pipelines are written in Groovy\n\n* GitHub Actions - PR builds, mostly\n\n\n\n\nYou have experience in Security:\n\n\n* Good understanding of OpenSSH\n\n* GnuPG for encryption of secrets and backups\n\n\n\n\nDistributed Systems:\n\n\n* Experience running Ethereum nodes\n\n* Knowledge of Layer 2 scaling solutions\n\n\n\n\n \n\nCompensation\n\nWe are happy to pay in any mix of fiat/crypto.\n\n \n\nHiring process\n\n* Interview with the Talent team\n\n* Paid task\n\n* Technical interview with Head of Infra\n\n\n\n[The steps may change along the way if we see it makes sense to adapt the interview stages, so please consider the above as a guideline]\n\n\n\n \n \n\n#Salary and compensation\n
No salary data published by company so we estimated salary based on similar jobs related to Web3, Python, DevOps, Senior and Engineer jobs that are similar:\n\n
$60,000 — $110,000/year\n

<strong>👉 Please reference you found the job on Remote OK, this helps us get more companies to post here, thanks!</strong><br><br>
When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site.

<strong>👉 Please reference you found the job on Remote OK, this helps us get more companies to post here, thanks!</strong><br><br>
When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.

<strong>👉 Please reference you found the job on Remote OK, this helps us get more companies to post here, thanks!</strong><br><br>
When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.

You get excited about creating deep insights into various crypto protocols using onchain data and supporting the data with broader qualitative research. You have a natural curiosity and love combing through all available data to help tell the story and inform opinions.\nYou love to build and are excited by the idea of working cross-functionally across Research, Product, and Engineering teams to help present and evolve our data analytics approach for Blockworks internally and for our subscribers. You're at home communicating with our audience via Twitter, podcasts, and other mediums about the state of the crypto industry and where it is moving. Lastly, you thrive in an environment where you can provide input and recommendations for data structure and the future of analytics.What You’ll Do:\nAs our Senior Research Data Analyst, you will be responsible for creating in-depth analytics and dashboards that track the health, profitability, and usership of various protocols and sectors. You'll also partner with our Research Services team to help manage and facilitate the data analytics aspects of client engagements. The outputs of your work will be viewed and consumed by broad audiences inside and outside the crypto industry.\nEvery day will look a little different, but in general, you will do things like:\n\n* \nAnalyze and Build Dashboards: You’ll own the creation and maintenance of new data dashboards forced on L1s, L2s, and popular dApps.\n\n* \nDesign and Craft Sector Data: You’ll aggregate and analyze new and existing data to help form comprehensive sector analytics and dashboards, pioneering actionable insights.\n\n* \nImprove Existing Dashboards: You’ll determine how we display data to improve our existing dashboards and highlight the best metrics for any given protocol.\n\n* \nDevelop Solutions and Manage Client Relationships: You'll work hand-in-hand with the Data Analytics Manager to help design, develop, and manage new data solutions for our services clients.\n\n* \nCollaborate with Protocol Teams: You’ll work directly with the protocol teams to aid in the data collection and analysis process, as well as manage client engagements and relationships.\n\n* \nContinuously Learn and Share Knowledge: You’ll proactively keep up-to-date with evolving themes, protocols, and technologies in the industry and share your learning with the broader Research and Blockworks teams.\n\n\n\nExperimentation is frequent at Blockworks. Comfortability with being uncomfortable is a must.What You’ve Done Before:\nYou have a passion for crypto and a relentless curiosity to grow knowledge base on multiple chains, and experience using various dApps. You have several years of professional work experience and success working with onchain data, and you can't wait to showcase some of your best results. You have demonstrated success showcasing and honing your analytical skills in addition to your technical skills and are always able to inform a point of view after reviewing underlying data. You've got hands-on experience working with onchain data with SQL in Dune, Flipside, or similar data analytics toolkits and a strong understanding of&nbsp;how to interact&nbsp;with data on different chains such as Ethereum (and other EVM chains), Solana, and Cosmos chains.&nbsp;You come with an understanding of smart contracts and how to use various block explorers. You're comfortable leading and managing projects independently and love getting hands-on in complex topics to help break them down and move them forward.It’d Be Great If You’ve Done This:\nMultiple years of experience in a data-heavy role or as a research analyst in crypto, TradFi, or consulting will move you to the top of our list. Having experience using dbt and Python or working in a cloud data warehouse like BigQuery will also set you apart from other candidates. If you have experience being active within a DAO or regularly looking into various governance forums, we also want to hear about it. Lastly, we're looking for incredibly strong communication skills that include a natural ability to explain the findings of your data inquiries in written form and spoken form in a way that is clear, cohesive, accurate, and can be easily understood by a broad audience.Salary, Benefits, &amp; How We Work:\nThis is a full time exempt position with an expected salary of $140,000/year.Benefits:\n\n* Commitment to an open, inclusive, and diverse work culture\n\n* Remote first organization with an office in NYC for you to utilize as you please\n\n* 14 weeks of fully paid parental leave\n\n* Fully paid medical, dental, and vision insurance for you + a significant portion covered for your dependents \n\n* 401(k) plan\n\n* Remote work-station stipend\n\n* Learning stipend\n\n* Team happy hours and outings (even while remote!)\n\n* Generous vacation and holiday policy\n\n* Commuter benefits\n\n\n\nWe know that diversity makes for the best problem-solving and creative thinking.

<strong>👉 Please reference you found the job on Remote OK, this helps us get more companies to post here, thanks!</strong><br><br>
When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.

When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>.

When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>.

<div class="markdown">\nSenior Data Analyst\nRemote\nFull-Time/Regular, Exempt\n#LI-Remote\n\n\nWho We Are:\nGetaround is the world’s first connected carsharing marketplace. Launched in 2011, Getaround is available today in more than 1,000 cities across the United States and Europe.\n\n\nWe connect safe, convenient, and affordable cars with people who need them to live and work via our peer-to-peer marketplace. Our proprietary connected car technology allows guests to book and unlock a wide variety of vehicles directly from our app without ever having to meet anyone in person, carry an access card, wait in line, or coordinate picking up keys, unlike traditional rental car services.\n\n\nGetaround is focused on providing economic opportunities to local communities. Our community includes guests who rely on our cars for on-demand mobility and entrepreneurial hosts (car owners) who share cars on our platform including those who operate their own carsharing businesses.&nbsp;\n\n\nDid you know cars are parked 22 hours a day on average? When we share cars, we don’t need as many on the road, which means fewer accidents, reduced traffic, and less space required for parking. Carsharing modernizes mobility by allowing people to connect multiple forms of efficient transportation for any type of use case.\n\n\nThrough carsharing, we aim to lessen greenhouse gasses and reduce pollution. Studies show that when carsharing is available, people drive less and drive vehicles more appropriate for their use case, which can reduce household carbon emissions by up to 40%. Also, shared cars are used more frequently and retired more quickly, accelerating the adoption of newer, more energy-efficient vehicles.\n\n\nOur mission is to empower people to carshare everywhere by enabling the shift away from car ownership, want to join us?\n\n\nYour Mission:\nGetaround is seeking a seasoned Data Analyst to join our team at Getaround.

When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.

<div class="markdown">\nJoin our small, fiery team on a mission to usher in the Bitcoin golden age.\n\nAbout Shakepay\n\nShakepay is reimagining financial services to give every Canadian their fair shake, by making it bitcoin-friendly, secure, and rewarding. When Shakepay launched in 2015, it quickly became one of Canada’s fastest-growing financial institutions. Backed by top venture funds having raised $44M+ and trusted by over one million Canadians and counting. People who choose careers at Shakepay are helping shape a future of financial freedom, opportunity, and prosperity for all Canadians.\n\nHead of Risk Data Science\n\nAs the Head of Risk Data Science, your role is pivotal in Shakepay’s journey. As we continue to add more products and features, your role will be to make sure that our customer experience remains delightful, while managing downside risk. This position demands not only an adept understanding of data science methodologies and state-of-the-art tools but also a keen product intuition and a passion for enhancing user experiences while managing risk effectively. Working hand-in-hand with product managers, engineers, and designers, you will harness the power of data to shape, innovate, and optimize our risk decisioning processes and underwriting models.\n\nYou will\n\n\n* Work with large and complex data sets to identify and solve challenging problems related to customer actions and risk decisioning with various analytical and statistical approaches.\n\n* Develop and refine models for risk assessment and underwriting to enhance decision-making processes and ensure robust risk management.\n\n* Define key performance indicators (KPIs) and set success and guardrail metrics for risk management.\n\n* Engage in deep partnership with Product Managers to align risk decisioning efforts with strategic business goals and communicate findings with senior management.\n\n* Manage controlled experiments (i.e., A/B/n tests) from design, data tracking and instrumentation, impact sizing, audience selection, and results analysis.\n\n* Collaborate with other data practitioners to share knowledge and participate in the evolution of Shakepay’s internal data platform, tooling and culture.\n\n* Conduct ad hoc investigations and make evidence-based recommendations that drive improvements in risk management and underwriting optimization.\n\n* Stay updated with industry trends and advancements in data science, risk decisioning, and underwriting to continually enhance Shakepay’s capabilities.\n\n\n\n\nMust have\n\n\n* Minimum of 5+ years of work experience in data science or analytics.\n\n* Strong understanding of risk management and underwriting in a fintech context.\n\n* Technical proficiency in one of Python or R in a data science context and SQL.\n\n* Ability to develop and optimize risk decision algorithms.\n\n* Experience in experiment &amp; A/B/n test design and analysis.\n\n* Experience conducting deep-dive statistical analysis (modeling, causality, regression, etc.).\n\n* A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with cross-functional teams and a high attention to detail.\n\n* Outstanding written and verbal communication skills. Ability to distill nuanced statistical findings accurately to a business audience is critical.\n\n* Knowledge of effective data visualization principles, tools, and techniques.\n\n* Some familiarity with dbt (our data transformation tool).\n\n\n\n\nNice to have\n\n\n* Experience with experimentation platforms like Statsig (we use it), Optimizely, Kameleoon, or others.\n\n* Startup experience is a big plus, bonus points for B2C fintech experience.\n\n* Experience working with cloud data warehouses (we use Snowflake).\n\n* Interest and enthusiasm for the possibilities enabled by Bitcoin and non-sovereign money.\n\n\n\n\nWhy join?&nbsp;\n\n\n* Be part of a groundbreaking journey: you'll live on the frontier of financial innovation. Bitcoin is rewriting the rules, and Shakepay is at the forefront.\n\n* Impact and scale: with only 2% of Canadians on Shakepay, the potential for growth is massive. You can help us bring Shakepay and bitcoin to all Canadians.\n\n* Rewarding benefits: we offer competitive compensation (every shaker owns stock options), benefits (health, dental, paramedical, disability, etc), and generous vacation time.\n\n* Embrace continuous learning: ambitious individuals with an insatiable thirst for knowledge will feel at home. Working at Shakepay means you'll be working in an environment that encourages constant growth and development.\n\n* Get paid in bitcoin: choose to take a percentage of your salary in the hardest, soundest money the world has ever known.\n\n* Work remote: work from anywhere in Canada. If you're in Montreal or Toronto, you can also work from our offices.\n\n\n\n\nWe understand that potential can be just as valuable as experience. If you're eager to learn, grow, and contribute to the mission but worry that you may not have the “right” experience, we still want you to apply. We encourage applications from everyone, regardless of background and life experience. We’re firm believers that a little bit of slope makes up for a lot of y-intercept.\n\nFluency in English is required due to the percentage of English-speaking customers and the nature of our platform, which is available to all Canadians. \n\n#Salary and compensation\n
No salary data published by company so we estimated salary based on similar jobs related to Design, Bitcoin, Python, Cloud and Senior jobs that are similar:\n\n
$50,000 — $85,000/year\n

<strong>👉 Please reference you found the job on Remote OK, this helps us get more companies to post here, thanks!</strong><br><br>
When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site.

Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter.

												<strong>👉 Please reference you found the job on Remote OK, this helps us get more companies to post here, thanks!</strong><br><br>
												When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.

But Status is also building foundational infrastructure for the whole Ethereum ecosystem, including the Nimbus ETH 1.0 and 2.0 clients, the Keycard hardware wallet, and the Waku messaging protocol, the p2p communication layer for Web3.\nAs a team, Status has been completely distributed since inception. Our team is currently 200+ core contributors strong, and welcomes a growing number of community members from all walks of life, scattered all around the globe. \nWe care deeply about open source, and our organizational structure has minimal hierarchy and no fixed work hours. We believe in working with a high degree of autonomy while supporting the organization's priorities.\n\n\n\n\nThe role\n\nDevOps is a buzzword, but it's also generic enough to encompass the breadth of tasks required in supporting development teams. There are many ways to make the lives of developers easier, and everyone has their own best way, which also means every team has their own way. There is no perfect way to make everyone happy with the same thing.\n\nSupporting developers involves debugging obscure bash scripts from years ago that nobody remembers. It means biting on a piece of wood and using data formats turned programming languages like YAML to configure CI jobs. It means tracking down minute differences between releases of packages and libraries causing unexpected crashes. It means rewriting the same Dockerfile for the 5th time to allow a project to use one more obscure library. Or tracking down absurd race conditions of multi-threaded tests running in parallel on the same host. Or pulling your hair out at a bug only to realize it works fine after the CI worker host is restarted.\n\nBut fundamentally it means wrestling it all into submission and making it run smoothly... at least for as long as you're there.\n\nIf you have the guts to fight against entropy and deterioration of the reality we inhabit, then you just might also be crazy enough to enjoy the struggle while it lasts, and appreciate the eventual fruits of our labour, if you value privacy, freedom, and transparency. You might even make some money, and learn a bit from all the exceptional engineers working here.\n\n \n\nWho you are\n\nYou have strong Linux Fundamentals:\n\n\n* Distros and package managers\n\n* Good understanding of process management\n\n\n\n\nYou have programming experience:\n\n\n* At least a few languages and showing the ability to learn\n\n* Bash as a minimum; Python would be helpful \n\n\n\n\nYou have experience in Continuous Integration:\n\n\n* Jenkins CI - Pipelines are written in Groovy\n\n* GitHub Actions - PR builds, mostly\n\n\n\n\nYou have experience in Security:\n\n\n* Good understanding of OpenSSH\n\n* GnuPG for encryption of secrets and backups\n\n\n\n\nDistributed Systems:\n\n\n* Experience running Ethereum nodes\n\n* Knowledge of Layer 2 scaling solutions\n\n\n\n\n \n\nCompensation\n\nWe are happy to pay in any mix of fiat/crypto.\n\n \n\nHiring process\n\n* Interview with the Talent team\n\n* Paid task\n\n* Technical interview with Head of Infra\n\n\n\n[The steps may change along the way if we see it makes sense to adapt the interview stages, so please consider the above as a guideline]\n\n\n\n \n																																																										\n\n#Salary and compensation\n

												<strong>👉 Please reference you found the job on Remote OK, this helps us get more companies to post here, thanks!</strong><br><br>
												When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.

												When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name.

												When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site.

When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>.

<div class="markdown">\nAbout Status\nStatus is building the tools and infrastructure for the advancement of a secure, private, and open web3. \nWith the high level goals of preserving the right to privacy, mitigating the risk of censorship, and promoting economic trade in a transparent, open manner, Status is building a community where anyone is welcome to join and contribute.\nAs an organization, Status seeks to push the web3 ecosystem forward through research, creation of developer tools, and support of the open source community. \nAs a product, Status is an open source, Ethereum-based app that gives users the power to chat, transact, and access a revolutionary world of Apps on the decentralized web. But Status is also building foundational infrastructure for the whole Ethereum ecosystem, including the Nimbus ETH 1.0 and 2.0 clients, the Keycard hardware wallet, and the Waku messaging protocol, the p2p communication layer for Web3.\nAs a team, Status has been completely distributed since inception. Our team is currently 200+ core contributors strong, and welcomes a growing number of community members from all walks of life, scattered all around the globe. \nWe care deeply about open source, and our organizational structure has minimal hierarchy and no fixed work hours. We believe in working with a high degree of autonomy while supporting the organization's priorities.\n\n\n\n\nThe role\n\nDevOps is a buzzword, but it's also generic enough to encompass the breadth of tasks required in supporting development teams. There are many ways to make the lives of developers easier, and everyone has their own best way, which also means every team has their own way. There is no perfect way to make everyone happy with the same thing.\n\nSupporting developers involves debugging obscure bash scripts from years ago that nobody remembers. It means biting on a piece of wood and using data formats turned programming languages like YAML to configure CI jobs. It means tracking down minute differences between releases of packages and libraries causing unexpected crashes. It means rewriting the same Dockerfile for the 5th time to allow a project to use one more obscure library. Or tracking down absurd race conditions of multi-threaded tests running in parallel on the same host. Or pulling your hair out at a bug only to realize it works fine after the CI worker host is restarted.\n\nBut fundamentally it means wrestling it all into submission and making it run smoothly... at least for as long as you're there.\n\nIf you have the guts to fight against entropy and deterioration of the reality we inhabit, then you just might also be crazy enough to enjoy the struggle while it lasts, and appreciate the eventual fruits of our labour, if you value privacy, freedom, and transparency. You might even make some money, and learn a bit from all the exceptional engineers working here.\n\n \n\nWho you are\n\nYou have strong Linux Fundamentals:\n\n\n* Distros and package managers\n\n* Good understanding of process management\n\n\n\n\nYou have programming experience:\n\n\n* At least a few languages and showing the ability to learn\n\n* Bash as a minimum; Python would be helpful \n\n\n\n\nYou have experience in Continuous Integration:\n\n\n* Jenkins CI - Pipelines are written in Groovy\n\n* GitHub Actions - PR builds, mostly\n\n\n\n\nYou have experience in Security:\n\n\n* Good understanding of OpenSSH\n\n* GnuPG for encryption of secrets and backups\n\n\n\n\nDistributed Systems:\n\n\n* Experience running Ethereum nodes\n\n* Knowledge of Layer 2 scaling solutions\n\n\n\n\n \n\nCompensation\n\nWe are happy to pay in any mix of fiat/crypto.\n\n \n\nHiring process\n\n* Interview with the Talent team\n\n* Paid task\n\n* Technical interview with Head of Infra\n\n\n\n[The steps may change along the way if we see it makes sense to adapt the interview stages, so please consider the above as a guideline]\n\n\n\n \n \n\n#Salary and compensation\n
No salary data published by company so we estimated salary based on similar jobs related to Web3, Python, DevOps, Senior and Engineer jobs that are similar:\n\n
$60,000 — $110,000/year\n

<strong>👉 Please reference you found the job on Remote OK, this helps us get more companies to post here, thanks!</strong><br><br>
When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>.

When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.

<strong>👉 Please reference you found the job on Remote OK, this helps us get more companies to post here, thanks!</strong><br><br>
When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.

When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them.

<div class="markdown">About Us:\nBlockworks is a financial media brand that delivers breaking news and premium insights about digital assets to millions of investors. Our content, newsletters, podcasts and events provide investors with the critical analysis and information they need to make smarter decisions about digital assets.Who You Are:\nYou have a burning passion for the crypto industry. You get excited about creating deep insights into various crypto protocols using onchain data and supporting the data with broader qualitative research. You have a natural curiosity and love combing through all available data to help tell the story and inform opinions.\nYou love to build and are excited by the idea of working cross-functionally across Research, Product, and Engineering teams to help present and evolve our data analytics approach for Blockworks internally and for our subscribers. You're at home communicating with our audience via Twitter, podcasts, and other mediums about the state of the crypto industry and where it is moving. Lastly, you thrive in an environment where you can provide input and recommendations for data structure and the future of analytics.What You’ll Do:\nAs our Senior Research Data Analyst, you will be responsible for creating in-depth analytics and dashboards that track the health, profitability, and usership of various protocols and sectors. You'll also partner with our Research Services team to help manage and facilitate the data analytics aspects of client engagements. The outputs of your work will be viewed and consumed by broad audiences inside and outside the crypto industry.\nEvery day will look a little different, but in general, you will do things like:\n\n* \nAnalyze and Build Dashboards: You’ll own the creation and maintenance of new data dashboards forced on L1s, L2s, and popular dApps.\n\n* \nDesign and Craft Sector Data: You’ll aggregate and analyze new and existing data to help form comprehensive sector analytics and dashboards, pioneering actionable insights.\n\n* \nImprove Existing Dashboards: You’ll determine how we display data to improve our existing dashboards and highlight the best metrics for any given protocol.\n\n* \nDevelop Solutions and Manage Client Relationships: You'll work hand-in-hand with the Data Analytics Manager to help design, develop, and manage new data solutions for our services clients.\n\n* \nCollaborate with Protocol Teams: You’ll work directly with the protocol teams to aid in the data collection and analysis process, as well as manage client engagements and relationships.\n\n* \nContinuously Learn and Share Knowledge: You’ll proactively keep up-to-date with evolving themes, protocols, and technologies in the industry and share your learning with the broader Research and Blockworks teams.\n\n\n\nExperimentation is frequent at Blockworks. Comfortability with being uncomfortable is a must.What You’ve Done Before:\nYou have a passion for crypto and a relentless curiosity to grow knowledge base on multiple chains, and experience using various dApps. You have several years of professional work experience and success working with onchain data, and you can't wait to showcase some of your best results. You have demonstrated success showcasing and honing your analytical skills in addition to your technical skills and are always able to inform a point of view after reviewing underlying data. You've got hands-on experience working with onchain data with SQL in Dune, Flipside, or similar data analytics toolkits and a strong understanding of&nbsp;how to interact&nbsp;with data on different chains such as Ethereum (and other EVM chains), Solana, and Cosmos chains.&nbsp;You come with an understanding of smart contracts and how to use various block explorers. You're comfortable leading and managing projects independently and love getting hands-on in complex topics to help break them down and move them forward.It’d Be Great If You’ve Done This:\nMultiple years of experience in a data-heavy role or as a research analyst in crypto, TradFi, or consulting will move you to the top of our list. Having experience using dbt and Python or working in a cloud data warehouse like BigQuery will also set you apart from other candidates. If you have experience being active within a DAO or regularly looking into various governance forums, we also want to hear about it. Lastly, we're looking for incredibly strong communication skills that include a natural ability to explain the findings of your data inquiries in written form and spoken form in a way that is clear, cohesive, accurate, and can be easily understood by a broad audience.Salary, Benefits, &amp; How We Work:\nThis is a full time exempt position with an expected salary of $140,000/year.Benefits:\n\n* Commitment to an open, inclusive, and diverse work culture\n\n* Remote first organization with an office in NYC for you to utilize as you please\n\n* 14 weeks of fully paid parental leave\n\n* Fully paid medical, dental, and vision insurance for you + a significant portion covered for your dependents \n\n* 401(k) plan\n\n* Remote work-station stipend\n\n* Learning stipend\n\n* Team happy hours and outings (even while remote!)\n\n* Generous vacation and holiday policy\n\n* Commuter benefits\n\n\n\nWe know that diversity makes for the best problem-solving and creative thinking.

When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>.

When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.

When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.

<strong>👉 Please reference you found the job on Remote OK, this helps us get more companies to post here, thanks!</strong><br><br>
When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.

<div class="markdown">\nSenior Data Analyst\nRemote\nFull-Time/Regular, Exempt\n#LI-Remote\n\n\nWho We Are:\nGetaround is the world’s first connected carsharing marketplace. Launched in 2011, Getaround is available today in more than 1,000 cities across the United States and Europe.\n\n\nWe connect safe, convenient, and affordable cars with people who need them to live and work via our peer-to-peer marketplace. Our proprietary connected car technology allows guests to book and unlock a wide variety of vehicles directly from our app without ever having to meet anyone in person, carry an access card, wait in line, or coordinate picking up keys, unlike traditional rental car services.\n\n\nGetaround is focused on providing economic opportunities to local communities. Our community includes guests who rely on our cars for on-demand mobility and entrepreneurial hosts (car owners) who share cars on our platform including those who operate their own carsharing businesses.&nbsp;\n\n\nDid you know cars are parked 22 hours a day on average? When we share cars, we don’t need as many on the road, which means fewer accidents, reduced traffic, and less space required for parking. Carsharing modernizes mobility by allowing people to connect multiple forms of efficient transportation for any type of use case.\n\n\nThrough carsharing, we aim to lessen greenhouse gasses and reduce pollution. Studies show that when carsharing is available, people drive less and drive vehicles more appropriate for their use case, which can reduce household carbon emissions by up to 40%. Also, shared cars are used more frequently and retired more quickly, accelerating the adoption of newer, more energy-efficient vehicles.\n\n\nOur mission is to empower people to carshare everywhere by enabling the shift away from car ownership, want to join us?\n\n\nYour Mission:\nGetaround is seeking a seasoned Data Analyst to join our team at Getaround.

When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>.

When Shakepay launched in 2015, it quickly became one of Canada’s fastest-growing financial institutions. Backed by top venture funds having raised $44M+ and trusted by over one million Canadians and counting. People who choose careers at Shakepay are helping shape a future of financial freedom, opportunity, and prosperity for all Canadians.\n\nHead of Risk Data Science\n\nAs the Head of Risk Data Science, your role is pivotal in Shakepay’s journey. As we continue to add more products and features, your role will be to make sure that our customer experience remains delightful, while managing downside risk. This position demands not only an adept understanding of data science methodologies and state-of-the-art tools but also a keen product intuition and a passion for enhancing user experiences while managing risk effectively. Working hand-in-hand with product managers, engineers, and designers, you will harness the power of data to shape, innovate, and optimize our risk decisioning processes and underwriting models.\n\nYou will\n\n\n* Work with large and complex data sets to identify and solve challenging problems related to customer actions and risk decisioning with various analytical and statistical approaches.\n\n* Develop and refine models for risk assessment and underwriting to enhance decision-making processes and ensure robust risk management.\n\n* Define key performance indicators (KPIs) and set success and guardrail metrics for risk management.\n\n* Engage in deep partnership with Product Managers to align risk decisioning efforts with strategic business goals and communicate findings with senior management.\n\n* Manage controlled experiments (i.e., A/B/n tests) from design, data tracking and instrumentation, impact sizing, audience selection, and results analysis.\n\n* Collaborate with other data practitioners to share knowledge and participate in the evolution of Shakepay’s internal data platform, tooling and culture.\n\n* Conduct ad hoc investigations and make evidence-based recommendations that drive improvements in risk management and underwriting optimization.\n\n* Stay updated with industry trends and advancements in data science, risk decisioning, and underwriting to continually enhance Shakepay’s capabilities.\n\n\n\n\nMust have\n\n\n* Minimum of 5+ years of work experience in data science or analytics.\n\n* Strong understanding of risk management and underwriting in a fintech context.\n\n* Technical proficiency in one of Python or R in a data science context and SQL.\n\n* Ability to develop and optimize risk decision algorithms.\n\n* Experience in experiment &amp; A/B/n test design and analysis.\n\n* Experience conducting deep-dive statistical analysis (modeling, causality, regression, etc.).\n\n* A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with cross-functional teams and a high attention to detail.\n\n* Outstanding written and verbal communication skills. Ability to distill nuanced statistical findings accurately to a business audience is critical.\n\n* Knowledge of effective data visualization principles, tools, and techniques.\n\n* Some familiarity with dbt (our data transformation tool).\n\n\n\n\nNice to have\n\n\n* Experience with experimentation platforms like Statsig (we use it), Optimizely, Kameleoon, or others.\n\n* Startup experience is a big plus, bonus points for B2C fintech experience.\n\n* Experience working with cloud data warehouses (we use Snowflake).\n\n* Interest and enthusiasm for the possibilities enabled by Bitcoin and non-sovereign money.\n\n\n\n\nWhy join?&nbsp;\n\n\n* Be part of a groundbreaking journey: you'll live on the frontier of financial innovation. Bitcoin is rewriting the rules, and Shakepay is at the forefront.\n\n* Impact and scale: with only 2% of Canadians on Shakepay, the potential for growth is massive. You can help us bring Shakepay and bitcoin to all Canadians.\n\n* Rewarding benefits: we offer competitive compensation (every shaker owns stock options), benefits (health, dental, paramedical, disability, etc), and generous vacation time.\n\n* Embrace continuous learning: ambitious individuals with an insatiable thirst for knowledge will feel at home. Working at Shakepay means you'll be working in an environment that encourages constant growth and development.\n\n* Get paid in bitcoin: choose to take a percentage of your salary in the hardest, soundest money the world has ever known.\n\n* Work remote: work from anywhere in Canada. If you're in Montreal or Toronto, you can also work from our offices.\n\n\n\n\nWe understand that potential can be just as valuable as experience. If you're eager to learn, grow, and contribute to the mission but worry that you may not have the “right” experience, we still want you to apply. We encourage applications from everyone, regardless of background and life experience. We’re firm believers that a little bit of slope makes up for a lot of y-intercept.\n\nFluency in English is required due to the percentage of English-speaking customers and the nature of our platform, which is available to all Canadians. \n\n#Salary and compensation\n
No salary data published by company so we estimated salary based on similar jobs related to Design, Bitcoin, Python, Cloud and Senior jobs that are similar:\n\n

									<div class="markdown">\nJoin our small, fiery team on a mission to usher in the Bitcoin golden age.\n\nAbout Shakepay\n\nShakepay is reimagining financial services to give every Canadian their fair shake, by making it bitcoin-friendly, secure, and rewarding. When Shakepay launched in 2015, it quickly became one of Canada’s fastest-growing financial institutions. Backed by top venture funds having raised $44M+ and trusted by over one million Canadians and counting. People who choose careers at Shakepay are helping shape a future of financial freedom, opportunity, and prosperity for all Canadians.\n\nHead of Data\n\nAs the Head of Data, your role is pivotal at Shakepay. You will be responsible for managing and implementing our data program and strategy as a whole. You’ll work with our executive and product teams to develop the priorities of the business and ensure our data platform and engineering teams understand what needs to be built to support those goals. You’ll lead our data scientists to produce internal data products that make problems and opportunities legible to all stakeholders, and customer facing data products that deliver real value and personalized experiences.\n\nYou will\n\n\n* Lead the execution of a comprehensive data analytics strategy aligned with business objectives\n\n* Build a data science function to support decision-making and influence the company strategy and product roadmaps\n\n* Manage and mentor our data team, and cultivate a culture of high performance\n\n* Implement Shakepay’s framework for automated decision making, risk detection and fraud prevention\n\n* Partner with cross-functional teams to prioritize deep-dives on key business questions\n\n* Evangelize a data-driven culture across the organization\n\n\n\n\nMust have\n\n\n* 5+ years of experience leading a data team&nbsp;\n\n* 7+ years of experience working on consumer facing products&nbsp;\n\n* Experience leading and building high-performing teams\n\n* Outstanding written and verbal communication skills. Ability to distill nuanced statistical findings accurately to a business audience is critical\n\n* Technical proficiency in one of Python or R in a data science context and SQL\n\n* Experience in experiment &amp; A/B/n test design and analysis\n\n* Experience conducting deep-dive statistical analysis (modeling, causality, regression, etc.)\n\n* A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with cross-functional teams and a high attention to detail\n\n* Experience communicating both in low-level technical details as well as high-level strategies\n\n* Knowledge of effective data visualization principles, tools and techniques\n\n* Some familiarity with dbt (our data transformation tool)\n\n\n\n\nNice to have\n\n\n* Experience with experimentation platforms like Statsig, Optimizely, Kameleoon, or others&nbsp;\n\n* Startup experience is a big plus, bonus points for B2C fintech experience\n\n* Experience in credit risk modeling, strategy, monitoring and forecasting\n\n* Experience working with cloud data warehouses (we use Snowflake)\n\n* Knowledge of bitcoin\n\n\n\n\nWhy join?&nbsp;\n\n\n* Be part of a groundbreaking journey: you'll live on the frontier of financial innovation. Bitcoin is rewriting the rules, and Shakepay is at the forefront.\n\n* Impact and scale: with only 2% of Canadians on Shakepay, the potential for growth is massive. You can help us bring Shakepay and bitcoin to all Canadians.\n\n* Rewarding benefits: we offer competitive compensation (every shaker owns stock options), benefits (health, dental, paramedical, disability, etc), and generous vacation time.\n\n* Embrace continuous learning: ambitious individuals with an insatiable thirst for knowledge will feel at home. Working at Shakepay means you'll be working in an environment that encourages constant growth and development.\n\n* Get paid in bitcoin: choose to take a percentage of your salary in the hardest, soundest money the world has ever known.\n\n* Work remote: work from anywhere in Canada. If you're in Montreal or Toronto, you can also work from our offices.\n\n\n\n\nWe understand that potential can be just as valuable as experience. If you're eager to learn, grow, and contribute to the mission but worry that you may not have the “right” experience, we still want you to apply. We encourage applications from everyone, regardless of background and life experience. We’re firm believers that a little bit of slope makes up for a lot of y-intercept.\n\nFluency in English is required due to the percentage of English-speaking customers and the nature of our platform, which is available to all Canadians.																																																										\n\n#Salary and compensation\n

												<strong>👉 Please reference you found the job on Remote OK, this helps us get more companies to post here, thanks!</strong><br><br>
												When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.

												<strong>👉 Please reference you found the job on Remote OK, this helps us get more companies to post here, thanks!</strong><br><br>
												When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site.

												When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site.

									<div class="markdown">\nAbout Status\nStatus is building the tools and infrastructure for the advancement of a secure, private, and open web3. \nWith the high level goals of preserving the right to privacy, mitigating the risk of censorship, and promoting economic trade in a transparent, open manner, Status is building a community where anyone is welcome to join and contribute.\nAs an organization, Status seeks to push the web3 ecosystem forward through research, creation of developer tools, and support of the open source community. \nAs a product, Status is an open source, Ethereum-based app that gives users the power to chat, transact, and access a revolutionary world of Apps on the decentralized web. But Status is also building foundational infrastructure for the whole Ethereum ecosystem, including the Nimbus ETH 1.0 and 2.0 clients, the Keycard hardware wallet, and the Waku messaging protocol, the p2p communication layer for Web3.\nAs a team, Status has been completely distributed since inception. Our team is currently 200+ core contributors strong, and welcomes a growing number of community members from all walks of life, scattered all around the globe. \nWe care deeply about open source, and our organizational structure has minimal hierarchy and no fixed work hours. We believe in working with a high degree of autonomy while supporting the organization's priorities.\n\n\n\n\nThe role\n\nDevOps is a buzzword, but it's also generic enough to encompass the breadth of tasks required in supporting development teams. There are many ways to make the lives of developers easier, and everyone has their own best way, which also means every team has their own way. There is no perfect way to make everyone happy with the same thing.\n\nSupporting developers involves debugging obscure bash scripts from years ago that nobody remembers. It means biting on a piece of wood and using data formats turned programming languages like YAML to configure CI jobs. It means tracking down minute differences between releases of packages and libraries causing unexpected crashes. It means rewriting the same Dockerfile for the 5th time to allow a project to use one more obscure library. Or tracking down absurd race conditions of multi-threaded tests running in parallel on the same host. Or pulling your hair out at a bug only to realize it works fine after the CI worker host is restarted.\n\nBut fundamentally it means wrestling it all into submission and making it run smoothly... at least for as long as you're there.\n\nIf you have the guts to fight against entropy and deterioration of the reality we inhabit, then you just might also be crazy enough to enjoy the struggle while it lasts, and appreciate the eventual fruits of our labour, if you value privacy, freedom, and transparency. You might even make some money, and learn a bit from all the exceptional engineers working here.\n\n \n\nWho you are\n\nYou have strong Linux Fundamentals:\n\n\n* Distros and package managers\n\n* Good understanding of process management\n\n\n\n\nYou have programming experience:\n\n\n* At least a few languages and showing the ability to learn\n\n* Bash as a minimum; Python would be helpful \n\n\n\n\nYou have experience in Continuous Integration:\n\n\n* Jenkins CI - Pipelines are written in Groovy\n\n* GitHub Actions - PR builds, mostly\n\n\n\n\nYou have experience in Security:\n\n\n* Good understanding of OpenSSH\n\n* GnuPG for encryption of secrets and backups\n\n\n\n\nDistributed Systems:\n\n\n* Experience running Ethereum nodes\n\n* Knowledge of Layer 2 scaling solutions\n\n\n\n\n \n\nCompensation\n\nWe are happy to pay in any mix of fiat/crypto.\n\n \n\nHiring process\n\n* Interview with the Talent team\n\n* Paid task\n\n* Technical interview with Head of Infra\n\n\n\n[The steps may change along the way if we see it makes sense to adapt the interview stages, so please consider the above as a guideline]\n\n\n\n \n																																																										\n\n#Salary and compensation\n
																											No salary data published by company so we estimated salary based on similar jobs related to Web3, Python, DevOps, Senior and Engineer jobs that are similar:\n\n

												<strong>👉 Please reference you found the job on Remote OK, this helps us get more companies to post here, thanks!</strong><br><br>
												When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.

												<strong>👉 Please reference you found the job on Remote OK, this helps us get more companies to post here, thanks!</strong><br><br>
												When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.

Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name.

									<div class="markdown">\n\nAbout us\n\nFlashbots started in 2020 as a research and development organization formed to mitigate the negative externalities and existential risks posed by Maximal Extractable Value (MEV). Since then, we have had an immense impact on the world of crypto through mev-geth, Flashbots Protect, MEV-Boost, MEV-Share, our open research and soon-to-be SUAVE.\n\n\nOur mission is clear: illuminate, democratize and distribute.\nWe seek to ensure that the value created on decentralized, public blockchains is transparent and distributed. We do this by conducting cutting-edge research, building mission-critical products, and coordinating a diverse community with competing interests.\n\nOur vibe is irreverent, anarchic, excellent, autonomous. We’re explorers, hackers, builders, thinkers. We are relaxed, composed, and at ease in the world, but beneath our suave exterior, we do not have the time or inclination to be anything but the best.\n\n\nWe are seeking a researcher with a PhD (or nearing completion) to join the cryptography and privacy team within Flashbots Research. \nWe would like to meet you if you have experience doing research on topics including:\n\n* Multi-Party Computation (MPC)\n\n* Trusted execution environments (TEEs)\n\n* Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)\n\n* Zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs\n\n* Operating Systems (OS) and CPU architectures\n\n* Security of distributed/decentralized systems\n\n* Multi/threshold-signature schemes\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to Expect in the Role:\n\n* You will be supported to identify interesting research problems, work toward solutions alone or with collaborators, and publish your findings in industry and academic venues\n\n* You will experience maximum autonomy, allowing you to claim ownership of research areas, set goals, and deadlines without needing constant supervision\n\n* You will be expected to make your voice heard and navigate the organization to gather information or make decisions as needed\n\n* You will establish and maintain academic collaborations to broaden our research horizons\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat You’ll need:\n\n* A PhD (or nearing completion) with work in a relevant area\n\n* Excellent communication skills: You will need to communicate asynchronously within the team, as well as present your work externally and to other members of the organization\n\n* Experience in a startup environment and working with cross-functional teams\n\n* The ability to write technical reports and publish research findings\n\n* Knowledge of common Web3 tech stacks, such as Ethereum\n\n* Our team operates in a fully remote environment, so you should be comfortable with that setup and effective in communicating asynchronously\n\n* - Ability to dissect and understand cryptographic protocols from theoretical descriptions\n\n* Experience identifying interesting research problems, completing research projects, and presenting results formally verbally and in writing\n\n\n\n\n\nNice to have:\n\n* Proficiency in software development, particularly in Python and Rust\n\n* Experience in security analysis, designing security and privacy attacks\n\n* Experience in remote-first environments, focusing on open, honest, and transparent communication\n\n* Exposure to the Maximum Extractable Value (MEV) problem space\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetails that matter\n\n\n* Significantly above market rate equity compensation package\n\n* Unlimited PTO with a high level of freedom and autonomy for your work\n\n* Attractive health coverage package for US employees\n\n* $3000 Yearly budget for your individual learning and development goals\n\n* Work alongside the brightest minds in the crypto space\n\n* Help save the world by ensuring crypto remains decentralized, permissionless and censorship-resistant\n\n* Remote working - work from anywhere in the world\n\n* Paid travel - 2 x team on-site in different parts of the world per year plus periodic travel to events\n\n\n\n\n\nAt Flashbots, we are committed to building a diverse and inclusive team.

												<strong>👉 Please reference you found the job on Remote OK, this helps us get more companies to post here, thanks!</strong><br><br>
												When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.

When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Status SNT is hiring a </span><br>Remote Senior DevOps Engineer </h1>
<div class="markdown">\nAbout Status\nStatus is building the tools and infrastructure for the advancement of a secure, private, and open web3. \nWith the high level goals of preserving the right to privacy, mitigating the risk of censorship, and promoting economic trade in a transparent, open manner, Status is building a community where anyone is welcome to join and contribute.\nAs an organization, Status seeks to push the web3 ecosystem forward through research, creation of developer tools, and support of the open source community. \nAs a product, Status is an open source, Ethereum-based app that gives users the power to chat, transact, and access a revolutionary world of Apps on the decentralized web. But Status is also building foundational infrastructure for the whole Ethereum ecosystem, including the Nimbus ETH 1.0 and 2.0 clients, the Keycard hardware wallet, and the Waku messaging protocol, the p2p communication layer for Web3.\nAs a team, Status has been completely distributed since inception. Our team is currently 200+ core contributors strong, and welcomes a growing number of community members from all walks of life, scattered all around the globe. \nWe care deeply about open source, and our organizational structure has minimal hierarchy and no fixed work hours. We believe in working with a high degree of autonomy while supporting the organization's priorities.\n\n\n\n\nThe role\n\nDevOps is a buzzword, but it's also generic enough to encompass the breadth of tasks required in supporting development teams. There are many ways to make the lives of developers easier, and everyone has their own best way, which also means every team has their own way. There is no perfect way to make everyone happy with the same thing.\n\nSupporting developers involves debugging obscure bash scripts from years ago that nobody remembers. It means biting on a piece of wood and using data formats turned programming languages like YAML to configure CI jobs. It means tracking down minute differences between releases of packages and libraries causing unexpected crashes. It means rewriting the same Dockerfile for the 5th time to allow a project to use one more obscure library. Or tracking down absurd race conditions of multi-threaded tests running in parallel on the same host. Or pulling your hair out at a bug only to realize it works fine after the CI worker host is restarted.\n\nBut fundamentally it means wrestling it all into submission and making it run smoothly... at least for as long as you're there.\n\nIf you have the guts to fight against entropy and deterioration of the reality we inhabit, then you just might also be crazy enough to enjoy the struggle while it lasts, and appreciate the eventual fruits of our labour, if you value privacy, freedom, and transparency. You might even make some money, and learn a bit from all the exceptional engineers working here.\n\n \n\nWho you are\n\nYou have strong Linux Fundamentals:\n\n\n* Distros and package managers\n\n* Good understanding of process management\n\n\n\n\nYou have programming experience:\n\n\n* At least a few languages and showing the ability to learn\n\n* Bash as a minimum; Python would be helpful \n\n\n\n\nYou have experience in Continuous Integration:\n\n\n* Jenkins CI - Pipelines are written in Groovy\n\n* GitHub Actions - PR builds, mostly\n\n\n\n\nYou have experience in Security:\n\n\n* Good understanding of OpenSSH\n\n* GnuPG for encryption of secrets and backups\n\n\n\n\nDistributed Systems:\n\n\n* Experience running Ethereum nodes\n\n* Knowledge of Layer 2 scaling solutions\n\n\n\n\n \n\nCompensation\n\nWe are happy to pay in any mix of fiat/crypto.\n\n \n\nHiring process\n\n* Interview with the Talent team\n\n* Paid task\n\n* Technical interview with Head of Infra\n\n\n\n[The steps may change along the way if we see it makes sense to adapt the interview stages, so please consider the above as a guideline]\n\n\n\n \n \n\n#Salary and compensation\n
No salary data published by company so we estimated salary based on similar jobs related to Web3, Python, DevOps, Senior and Engineer jobs that are similar:\n\n
$60,000 — $110,000/year\n

When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site.

<strong>👉 Please reference you found the job on Remote OK, this helps us get more companies to post here, thanks!</strong><br><br>
When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.

<strong>👉 Please reference you found the job on Remote OK, this helps us get more companies to post here, thanks!</strong><br><br>
When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.

The outputs of your work will be viewed and consumed by broad audiences inside and outside the crypto industry.\nEvery day will look a little different, but in general, you will do things like:\n\n* \nAnalyze and Build Dashboards: You’ll own the creation and maintenance of new data dashboards forced on L1s, L2s, and popular dApps.\n\n* \nDesign and Craft Sector Data: You’ll aggregate and analyze new and existing data to help form comprehensive sector analytics and dashboards, pioneering actionable insights.\n\n* \nImprove Existing Dashboards: You’ll determine how we display data to improve our existing dashboards and highlight the best metrics for any given protocol.\n\n* \nDevelop Solutions and Manage Client Relationships: You'll work hand-in-hand with the Data Analytics Manager to help design, develop, and manage new data solutions for our services clients.\n\n* \nCollaborate with Protocol Teams: You’ll work directly with the protocol teams to aid in the data collection and analysis process, as well as manage client engagements and relationships.\n\n* \nContinuously Learn and Share Knowledge: You’ll proactively keep up-to-date with evolving themes, protocols, and technologies in the industry and share your learning with the broader Research and Blockworks teams.\n\n\n\nExperimentation is frequent at Blockworks. Comfortability with being uncomfortable is a must.What You’ve Done Before:\nYou have a passion for crypto and a relentless curiosity to grow knowledge base on multiple chains, and experience using various dApps. You have several years of professional work experience and success working with onchain data, and you can't wait to showcase some of your best results. You have demonstrated success showcasing and honing your analytical skills in addition to your technical skills and are always able to inform a point of view after reviewing underlying data. You've got hands-on experience working with onchain data with SQL in Dune, Flipside, or similar data analytics toolkits and a strong understanding of&nbsp;how to interact&nbsp;with data on different chains such as Ethereum (and other EVM chains), Solana, and Cosmos chains.&nbsp;You come with an understanding of smart contracts and how to use various block explorers. You're comfortable leading and managing projects independently and love getting hands-on in complex topics to help break them down and move them forward.It’d Be Great If You’ve Done This:\nMultiple years of experience in a data-heavy role or as a research analyst in crypto, TradFi, or consulting will move you to the top of our list. Having experience using dbt and Python or working in a cloud data warehouse like BigQuery will also set you apart from other candidates. If you have experience being active within a DAO or regularly looking into various governance forums, we also want to hear about it. Lastly, we're looking for incredibly strong communication skills that include a natural ability to explain the findings of your data inquiries in written form and spoken form in a way that is clear, cohesive, accurate, and can be easily understood by a broad audience.Salary, Benefits, &amp; How We Work:\nThis is a full time exempt position with an expected salary of $140,000/year.Benefits:\n\n* Commitment to an open, inclusive, and diverse work culture\n\n* Remote first organization with an office in NYC for you to utilize as you please\n\n* 14 weeks of fully paid parental leave\n\n* Fully paid medical, dental, and vision insurance for you + a significant portion covered for your dependents \n\n* 401(k) plan\n\n* Remote work-station stipend\n\n* Learning stipend\n\n* Team happy hours and outings (even while remote!)\n\n* Generous vacation and holiday policy\n\n* Commuter benefits\n\n\n\nWe know that diversity makes for the best problem-solving and creative thinking.

<strong>👉 Please reference you found the job on Remote OK, this helps us get more companies to post here, thanks!</strong><br><br>
When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.

When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name.

<strong>👉 Please reference you found the job on Remote OK, this helps us get more companies to post here, thanks!</strong><br><br>
When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.

When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.

<div class="markdown">\nSenior Data Analyst\nRemote\nFull-Time/Regular, Exempt\n#LI-Remote\n\n\nWho We Are:\nGetaround is the world’s first connected carsharing marketplace.

Our proprietary connected car technology allows guests to book and unlock a wide variety of vehicles directly from our app without ever having to meet anyone in person, carry an access card, wait in line, or coordinate picking up keys, unlike traditional rental car services.\n\n\nGetaround is focused on providing economic opportunities to local communities. Our community includes guests who rely on our cars for on-demand mobility and entrepreneurial hosts (car owners) who share cars on our platform including those who operate their own carsharing businesses.&nbsp;\n\n\nDid you know cars are parked 22 hours a day on average? When we share cars, we don’t need as many on the road, which means fewer accidents, reduced traffic, and less space required for parking. Carsharing modernizes mobility by allowing people to connect multiple forms of efficient transportation for any type of use case.\n\n\nThrough carsharing, we aim to lessen greenhouse gasses and reduce pollution. Studies show that when carsharing is available, people drive less and drive vehicles more appropriate for their use case, which can reduce household carbon emissions by up to 40%. Also, shared cars are used more frequently and retired more quickly, accelerating the adoption of newer, more energy-efficient vehicles.\n\n\nOur mission is to empower people to carshare everywhere by enabling the shift away from car ownership, want to join us?\n\n\nYour Mission:\nGetaround is seeking a seasoned Data Analyst to join our team at Getaround.

When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.

People who choose careers at Shakepay are helping shape a future of financial freedom, opportunity, and prosperity for all Canadians.\n\nHead of Risk Data Science\n\nAs the Head of Risk Data Science, your role is pivotal in Shakepay’s journey. As we continue to add more products and features, your role will be to make sure that our customer experience remains delightful, while managing downside risk. This position demands not only an adept understanding of data science methodologies and state-of-the-art tools but also a keen product intuition and a passion for enhancing user experiences while managing risk effectively. Working hand-in-hand with product managers, engineers, and designers, you will harness the power of data to shape, innovate, and optimize our risk decisioning processes and underwriting models.\n\nYou will\n\n\n* Work with large and complex data sets to identify and solve challenging problems related to customer actions and risk decisioning with various analytical and statistical approaches.\n\n* Develop and refine models for risk assessment and underwriting to enhance decision-making processes and ensure robust risk management.\n\n* Define key performance indicators (KPIs) and set success and guardrail metrics for risk management.\n\n* Engage in deep partnership with Product Managers to align risk decisioning efforts with strategic business goals and communicate findings with senior management.\n\n* Manage controlled experiments (i.e., A/B/n tests) from design, data tracking and instrumentation, impact sizing, audience selection, and results analysis.\n\n* Collaborate with other data practitioners to share knowledge and participate in the evolution of Shakepay’s internal data platform, tooling and culture.\n\n* Conduct ad hoc investigations and make evidence-based recommendations that drive improvements in risk management and underwriting optimization.\n\n* Stay updated with industry trends and advancements in data science, risk decisioning, and underwriting to continually enhance Shakepay’s capabilities.\n\n\n\n\nMust have\n\n\n* Minimum of 5+ years of work experience in data science or analytics.\n\n* Strong understanding of risk management and underwriting in a fintech context.\n\n* Technical proficiency in one of Python or R in a data science context and SQL.\n\n* Ability to develop and optimize risk decision algorithms.\n\n* Experience in experiment &amp; A/B/n test design and analysis.\n\n* Experience conducting deep-dive statistical analysis (modeling, causality, regression, etc.).\n\n* A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with cross-functional teams and a high attention to detail.\n\n* Outstanding written and verbal communication skills. Ability to distill nuanced statistical findings accurately to a business audience is critical.\n\n* Knowledge of effective data visualization principles, tools, and techniques.\n\n* Some familiarity with dbt (our data transformation tool).\n\n\n\n\nNice to have\n\n\n* Experience with experimentation platforms like Statsig (we use it), Optimizely, Kameleoon, or others.\n\n* Startup experience is a big plus, bonus points for B2C fintech experience.\n\n* Experience working with cloud data warehouses (we use Snowflake).\n\n* Interest and enthusiasm for the possibilities enabled by Bitcoin and non-sovereign money.\n\n\n\n\nWhy join?&nbsp;\n\n\n* Be part of a groundbreaking journey: you'll live on the frontier of financial innovation. Bitcoin is rewriting the rules, and Shakepay is at the forefront.\n\n* Impact and scale: with only 2% of Canadians on Shakepay, the potential for growth is massive. You can help us bring Shakepay and bitcoin to all Canadians.\n\n* Rewarding benefits: we offer competitive compensation (every shaker owns stock options), benefits (health, dental, paramedical, disability, etc), and generous vacation time.\n\n* Embrace continuous learning: ambitious individuals with an insatiable thirst for knowledge will feel at home. Working at Shakepay means you'll be working in an environment that encourages constant growth and development.\n\n* Get paid in bitcoin: choose to take a percentage of your salary in the hardest, soundest money the world has ever known.\n\n* Work remote: work from anywhere in Canada. If you're in Montreal or Toronto, you can also work from our offices.\n\n\n\n\nWe understand that potential can be just as valuable as experience. If you're eager to learn, grow, and contribute to the mission but worry that you may not have the “right” experience, we still want you to apply. We encourage applications from everyone, regardless of background and life experience. We’re firm believers that a little bit of slope makes up for a lot of y-intercept.\n\nFluency in English is required due to the percentage of English-speaking customers and the nature of our platform, which is available to all Canadians. \n\n#Salary and compensation\n
No salary data published by company so we estimated salary based on similar jobs related to Design, Bitcoin, Python, Cloud and Senior jobs that are similar:\n\n

									<div class="markdown">\nJoin our small, fiery team on a mission to usher in the Bitcoin golden age.\n\nAbout Shakepay\n\nShakepay is reimagining financial services to give every Canadian their fair shake, by making it bitcoin-friendly, secure, and rewarding. When Shakepay launched in 2015, it quickly became one of Canada’s fastest-growing financial institutions. Backed by top venture funds having raised $44M+ and trusted by over one million Canadians and counting. People who choose careers at Shakepay are helping shape a future of financial freedom, opportunity, and prosperity for all Canadians.\n\nHead of Data\n\nAs the Head of Data, your role is pivotal at Shakepay. You will be responsible for managing and implementing our data program and strategy as a whole. You’ll work with our executive and product teams to develop the priorities of the business and ensure our data platform and engineering teams understand what needs to be built to support those goals. You’ll lead our data scientists to produce internal data products that make problems and opportunities legible to all stakeholders, and customer facing data products that deliver real value and personalized experiences.\n\nYou will\n\n\n* Lead the execution of a comprehensive data analytics strategy aligned with business objectives\n\n* Build a data science function to support decision-making and influence the company strategy and product roadmaps\n\n* Manage and mentor our data team, and cultivate a culture of high performance\n\n* Implement Shakepay’s framework for automated decision making, risk detection and fraud prevention\n\n* Partner with cross-functional teams to prioritize deep-dives on key business questions\n\n* Evangelize a data-driven culture across the organization\n\n\n\n\nMust have\n\n\n* 5+ years of experience leading a data team&nbsp;\n\n* 7+ years of experience working on consumer facing products&nbsp;\n\n* Experience leading and building high-performing teams\n\n* Outstanding written and verbal communication skills. Ability to distill nuanced statistical findings accurately to a business audience is critical\n\n* Technical proficiency in one of Python or R in a data science context and SQL\n\n* Experience in experiment &amp; A/B/n test design and analysis\n\n* Experience conducting deep-dive statistical analysis (modeling, causality, regression, etc.)\n\n* A demonstrated ability to manage and deliver on multiple projects with cross-functional teams and a high attention to detail\n\n* Experience communicating both in low-level technical details as well as high-level strategies\n\n* Knowledge of effective data visualization principles, tools and techniques\n\n* Some familiarity with dbt (our data transformation tool)\n\n\n\n\nNice to have\n\n\n* Experience with experimentation platforms like Statsig, Optimizely, Kameleoon, or others&nbsp;\n\n* Startup experience is a big plus, bonus points for B2C fintech experience\n\n* Experience in credit risk modeling, strategy, monitoring and forecasting\n\n* Experience working with cloud data warehouses (we use Snowflake)\n\n* Knowledge of bitcoin\n\n\n\n\nWhy join?&nbsp;\n\n\n* Be part of a groundbreaking journey: you'll live on the frontier of financial innovation. Bitcoin is rewriting the rules, and Shakepay is at the forefront.\n\n* Impact and scale: with only 2% of Canadians on Shakepay, the potential for growth is massive. You can help us bring Shakepay and bitcoin to all Canadians.\n\n* Rewarding benefits: we offer competitive compensation (every shaker owns stock options), benefits (health, dental, paramedical, disability, etc), and generous vacation time.\n\n* Embrace continuous learning: ambitious individuals with an insatiable thirst for knowledge will feel at home. Working at Shakepay means you'll be working in an environment that encourages constant growth and development.\n\n* Get paid in bitcoin: choose to take a percentage of your salary in the hardest, soundest money the world has ever known.\n\n* Work remote: work from anywhere in Canada. If you're in Montreal or Toronto, you can also work from our offices.\n\n\n\n\nWe understand that potential can be just as valuable as experience. If you're eager to learn, grow, and contribute to the mission but worry that you may not have the “right” experience, we still want you to apply. We encourage applications from everyone, regardless of background and life experience. We’re firm believers that a little bit of slope makes up for a lot of y-intercept.\n\nFluency in English is required due to the percentage of English-speaking customers and the nature of our platform, which is available to all Canadians.																																																										\n\n#Salary and compensation\n

												<strong>👉 Please reference you found the job on Remote OK, this helps us get more companies to post here, thanks!</strong><br><br>
												When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.

Brightwheel’s vision is to enable high quality early education for every child&nbsp;—&nbsp;by giving teachers meaningfully more time with students each day, engaging parents in the development of their kids, and supporting the small businesses that make up the backbone of the $175 billion early education market.

												<strong>👉 Please reference you found the job on Remote OK, this helps us get more companies to post here, thanks!</strong><br><br>
												When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>.

												When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.

									<div class="markdown">\nAbout Status\nStatus is building the tools and infrastructure for the advancement of a secure, private, and open web3. \nWith the high level goals of preserving the right to privacy, mitigating the risk of censorship, and promoting economic trade in a transparent, open manner, Status is building a community where anyone is welcome to join and contribute.\nAs an organization, Status seeks to push the web3 ecosystem forward through research, creation of developer tools, and support of the open source community. \nAs a product, Status is an open source, Ethereum-based app that gives users the power to chat, transact, and access a revolutionary world of Apps on the decentralized web. But Status is also building foundational infrastructure for the whole Ethereum ecosystem, including the Nimbus ETH 1.0 and 2.0 clients, the Keycard hardware wallet, and the Waku messaging protocol, the p2p communication layer for Web3.\nAs a team, Status has been completely distributed since inception. Our team is currently 200+ core contributors strong, and welcomes a growing number of community members from all walks of life, scattered all around the globe. \nWe care deeply about open source, and our organizational structure has minimal hierarchy and no fixed work hours. We believe in working with a high degree of autonomy while supporting the organization's priorities.\n\n\n\n\nThe role\n\nDevOps is a buzzword, but it's also generic enough to encompass the breadth of tasks required in supporting development teams. There are many ways to make the lives of developers easier, and everyone has their own best way, which also means every team has their own way. There is no perfect way to make everyone happy with the same thing.\n\nSupporting developers involves debugging obscure bash scripts from years ago that nobody remembers. It means biting on a piece of wood and using data formats turned programming languages like YAML to configure CI jobs. It means tracking down minute differences between releases of packages and libraries causing unexpected crashes. It means rewriting the same Dockerfile for the 5th time to allow a project to use one more obscure library. Or tracking down absurd race conditions of multi-threaded tests running in parallel on the same host. Or pulling your hair out at a bug only to realize it works fine after the CI worker host is restarted.\n\nBut fundamentally it means wrestling it all into submission and making it run smoothly... at least for as long as you're there.\n\nIf you have the guts to fight against entropy and deterioration of the reality we inhabit, then you just might also be crazy enough to enjoy the struggle while it lasts, and appreciate the eventual fruits of our labour, if you value privacy, freedom, and transparency. You might even make some money, and learn a bit from all the exceptional engineers working here.\n\n \n\nWho you are\n\nYou have strong Linux Fundamentals:\n\n\n* Distros and package managers\n\n* Good understanding of process management\n\n\n\n\nYou have programming experience:\n\n\n* At least a few languages and showing the ability to learn\n\n* Bash as a minimum; Python would be helpful \n\n\n\n\nYou have experience in Continuous Integration:\n\n\n* Jenkins CI - Pipelines are written in Groovy\n\n* GitHub Actions - PR builds, mostly\n\n\n\n\nYou have experience in Security:\n\n\n* Good understanding of OpenSSH\n\n* GnuPG for encryption of secrets and backups\n\n\n\n\nDistributed Systems:\n\n\n* Experience running Ethereum nodes\n\n* Knowledge of Layer 2 scaling solutions\n\n\n\n\n \n\nCompensation\n\nWe are happy to pay in any mix of fiat/crypto.\n\n \n\nHiring process\n\n* Interview with the Talent team\n\n* Paid task\n\n* Technical interview with Head of Infra\n\n\n\n[The steps may change along the way if we see it makes sense to adapt the interview stages, so please consider the above as a guideline]\n\n\n\n \n																																																										\n\n#Salary and compensation\n

												<strong>👉 Please reference you found the job on Remote OK, this helps us get more companies to post here, thanks!</strong><br><br>
												When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.

												<strong>👉 Please reference you found the job on Remote OK, this helps us get more companies to post here, thanks!</strong><br><br>
												When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.

Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name.

									<div class="markdown">\n\nAbout us\n\nFlashbots started in 2020 as a research and development organization formed to mitigate the negative externalities and existential risks posed by Maximal Extractable Value (MEV). Since then, we have had an immense impact on the world of crypto through mev-geth, Flashbots Protect, MEV-Boost, MEV-Share, our open research and soon-to-be SUAVE.\n\n\nOur mission is clear: illuminate, democratize and distribute.\nWe seek to ensure that the value created on decentralized, public blockchains is transparent and distributed. We do this by conducting cutting-edge research, building mission-critical products, and coordinating a diverse community with competing interests.\n\nOur vibe is irreverent, anarchic, excellent, autonomous. We’re explorers, hackers, builders, thinkers. We are relaxed, composed, and at ease in the world, but beneath our suave exterior, we do not have the time or inclination to be anything but the best.\n\n\nWe are seeking a researcher with a PhD (or nearing completion) to join the cryptography and privacy team within Flashbots Research. \nWe would like to meet you if you have experience doing research on topics including:\n\n* Multi-Party Computation (MPC)\n\n* Trusted execution environments (TEEs)\n\n* Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)\n\n* Zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs\n\n* Operating Systems (OS) and CPU architectures\n\n* Security of distributed/decentralized systems\n\n* Multi/threshold-signature schemes\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to Expect in the Role:\n\n* You will be supported to identify interesting research problems, work toward solutions alone or with collaborators, and publish your findings in industry and academic venues\n\n* You will experience maximum autonomy, allowing you to claim ownership of research areas, set goals, and deadlines without needing constant supervision\n\n* You will be expected to make your voice heard and navigate the organization to gather information or make decisions as needed\n\n* You will establish and maintain academic collaborations to broaden our research horizons\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat You’ll need:\n\n* A PhD (or nearing completion) with work in a relevant area\n\n* Excellent communication skills: You will need to communicate asynchronously within the team, as well as present your work externally and to other members of the organization\n\n* Experience in a startup environment and working with cross-functional teams\n\n* The ability to write technical reports and publish research findings\n\n* Knowledge of common Web3 tech stacks, such as Ethereum\n\n* Our team operates in a fully remote environment, so you should be comfortable with that setup and effective in communicating asynchronously\n\n* - Ability to dissect and understand cryptographic protocols from theoretical descriptions\n\n* Experience identifying interesting research problems, completing research projects, and presenting results formally verbally and in writing\n\n\n\n\n\nNice to have:\n\n* Proficiency in software development, particularly in Python and Rust\n\n* Experience in security analysis, designing security and privacy attacks\n\n* Experience in remote-first environments, focusing on open, honest, and transparent communication\n\n* Exposure to the Maximum Extractable Value (MEV) problem space\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetails that matter\n\n\n* Significantly above market rate equity compensation package\n\n* Unlimited PTO with a high level of freedom and autonomy for your work\n\n* Attractive health coverage package for US employees\n\n* $3000 Yearly budget for your individual learning and development goals\n\n* Work alongside the brightest minds in the crypto space\n\n* Help save the world by ensuring crypto remains decentralized, permissionless and censorship-resistant\n\n* Remote working - work from anywhere in the world\n\n* Paid travel - 2 x team on-site in different parts of the world per year plus periodic travel to events\n\n\n\n\n\nAt Flashbots, we are committed to building a diverse and inclusive team.

												<strong>👉 Please reference you found the job on Remote OK, this helps us get more companies to post here, thanks!</strong><br><br>
												When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.
