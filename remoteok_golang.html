<strong>👉 Please reference you found the job on Remote OK, this helps us get more companies to post here, thanks!</strong><br><br>
When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.

<div class="markdown">\nOur mission is to unlock the collaborative power of communities by making Web3 universally easy to use, access, and build on.\n\nWorking with Consensys puts you at the forefront of an evolving paradigm, transforming our society for the better. We fundamentally believe blockchain is the next generation of technology that can lay the foundation for a more just and equitable society.&nbsp;\n\nBlockchain tech is just over 10 years old. Ethereum itself is still a toddler and we’re far from reaching our full potential. You’ll get to work on the tools, infrastructure, and apps that scale these platforms to billions of users.&nbsp;\n\nYou’ll be constantly exposed to new concepts, ideas, and frameworks from your peers, and as you work on different projects — challenging you to stay at the top of your game. You’ll join a network of entrepreneurs and technologists that reaches the edge of our ecosystem. Consensys alumni have moved on to become tech entrepreneurs, CEOs, and team leads at tech companies.\n\n\nAbout Infura\n\nInfura is the leading infrastructure platform providing scalable and easy-to-use APIs and cloud solutions for blockchain and decentralized application developers. Infura currently offers APIs for Ethereum, IPFS, and other leading decentralized networks, allowing developers to immediately begin building instead of spending time on architecting and maintaining their own infrastructure.\n\nInfura provides developers instant access to decentralized and blockchain networks without the need to sync or understand complicated peer to peer infrastructure. Similar to how one might access a cloud service to alleviate the friction of owning proprietary compute and storage, Infura lowers the barrier to entry for engineers to begin building.\n\nWe believe in a more equitable and decentralized future, and we know developers will be at the forefront of that progress. We want to empower developers to spend their time building, creating, and evolving by providing them with the best and easiest solution to their infrastructure needs.\n\nSome things to know about the Infura team, we are a remote first company, with team members all over the world. We strive to reduce meetings, respect work life balance, promote diversity, and generally be good people. We depend on each other not only to make an amazing product but to be a group that wants to succeed together.&nbsp;\n\n\nWhat you’ll do\n\nThe commercial platform team builds tools and platforms for monetizing and commercializing APIs and other developer offerings. Our commercial platform allows our product teams to rapidly build out support for offering public access and provides our customers with tools to understand and control their usage of those products. You will be developing tools and services within Kubernetes that allow us to easily stand up, operate, and monetize APIs at scale.\n\n\nWould be great if you brought this to the role\n\nYou have mastery over Golang or similar systems languages. You also have significant experience building with and operating service mesh / traffic routing proxies. You have solid experience with event-based systems and programming in cloud environments. You are knowledgeable about cloud based environments and understand things like object storage, databases (relational and NoSQL variants), and infrastructure management.\n\n\nDon't meet all the requirements? Don't sweat it. We’re passionate about building a diverse team of humans and as such, if you think you've got what it takes for our chaotic-but-fun, remote-friendly, start-up environment—apply anyway, detailing your relevant transferable skills in your cover letter. While we have a pretty good idea of what we need, we're ready for you to challenge our thinking on who needs to be in this role.\n\nConsensys is an equal opportunity employer. We encourage people from all backgrounds to apply. We are committed to ensuring that our technology is made available and accessible to everyone. All employment decisions are made without regard to race, color, national origin, ancestry, sex, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, age, genetic information, religion, disability, medical condition, pregnancy, marital status, family status, veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by law. Consensys is aware of fraudulent recruitment practices and we encourage all applicants to review our best practices to protect yourself which can be found (https://consensys.net/careers/best-practices-to-avoid-recruitment-fraud/). \n\n#Salary and compensation\n

Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter.

We make KYC credentials as movable as tokens, across different chains and ecosystems. We\u2019re in production with a few select partners, and are currently pushing towards v1 just in time for the next mass adoption cycle.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">idOS is hiring a </span><br>Remote Backend Web3 Developer </h1>
<div class="markdown">\nWhat is the idOS? The idOS network is the decentralized, self-sovereign, compliant identity layer of web3. We make KYC credentials as movable as tokens, across different chains and ecosystems. We’re in production with a few select partners, and are currently pushing towards v1 just in time for the next mass adoption cycle. The core of idOS is a permissioned blockchain deployment (based on Kwil), running extensions (written in Golang) that connect to several blockchains (EVMs, NEAR, and more to come). We also develop a TypeScript SDK to make integration as effortless as possible. Some of our current tech challenges are:\n\n* expanding support across even more chains (more EVMs, Solana, etc)\n\n* making idOS even easier to understand and integrate, ideally by removing as many clicks and function calls as possible\n\n* deployment of novel encryption and zk tech towards bolstering user privacy and easing development experience\n\n\n\nRole and responsibilities\n\n* Build reliable and highly-available backend services for authentication, authorization, blockchain interaction, and indexing.\n\n* Build secure, upgradable smart contracts across several blockchain infrastructures.\n\n* Write reliable SDKs enabling developers to seamlessly interact with the idOS and provide users with a magical experience.\n\n* Contribute to our developer documentation and tooling to make idOS integration the smoothest developer experience in web3.\n\n* Create applications showing off the full potential of the idOS.\n\n* Drive idOS innovation by staying abreast of new trends, patterns, and tools we can use to keep our applications secure and on the bleeding edge.\n\n* Communicate effectively, clearly articulate ideas, and engage productively with us to help us make better decisions.\n\n* Clearly and frequently communicate progress and concerns in an actionable manner.\n\n* Work in a highly collaborative open source ecosystem, writing and reviewing understandable code we can be proud of.\n\n* Help our integrators succeed by helping them with integration architecture and technical support. Our success comes from their success.\n\n\n\nRequirements\n\n* You have 2+ years of professional experience with solidity and/or vyper.\n\n* You have 3+ years of professional experience with distributed systems (you know when to use ZeroMQ vs. Kafka vs. MQTT vs. NATS, etc).\n\n* You’re experienced in shipping production code, and dealing with very different load profiles. You’re comfortable architecting a solution for 1 rps to 1k rps, from a few MB to a lot of TB.\n\n* You’re comfortable in modern UNIX environments. You know how to use strace, lsof, cgroups, etc., and bash lines like find . -type f | xargs sed -i … don’t scare you.\n\n* You don’t shy away from frontend work. It’s ok if you can’t do SVG or animations, but you wouldn’t think twice about adding a new React Provider and passing some props around.\n\n* You have a natural tendency to write good code, but you also understand that “good code” is a matter of aesthetics, familiarity, and style.\n\n* You're able to work autonomously from research and speccing, to deployment and monitoring; you thrive in taking greater ownership and responsibility.\n\n* You are proactive and take action by default, consistently driving progress without asking for permission too much. You make others aware of how, when, where, and why you’re cowboying.\n\n* You know how to identify that a task is starting to overrun its original scope/budget, and know when to back off from rabbit holes.\n\n* You are fluent in spoken and written English. Remote comms are already hard enough.\n\n* You have experience using web3 apps and tools such as Uniswap, Aave, or MetaMask.\n\n* You are familiar with basic cryptography, and curious about harder cryptography.\n\n* You're somewhere within UTC±3.\n\n* You can provide a reference for a call.\n\n* You have experience building and documenting APIs, SDKs, and other developer-directed products. You’d be comfortable writing a draft for an EIP and work with community feedback.\n\n* You challenge people’s opinions and direction, but know the value of “disagree and commit”.\n\n* You're excited about blockchain technology, cryptoeconomics, game theory, and decentralization. It’s not about shitcoins, it’s about real products for real people.\n\n\n\nNice to have\n\n* Experience with identity and authentication tech helps a lot. OpenID, OAuth, WebAuthN, Passkeys, U2F, LDAP, SAML, etc; any of these will be useful.\n\n* Experience with non-EVM blockchains.\n\n* You know enough about Golang such that using ChatGPT doesn’t help you out a lot anymore.\n\n\n\nTechs we use\n\n* JavaScript/TypeScript (a lot; frontend and backend), Golang (a moderate amount, for chain extensions), Rust and Solidity (for smart contracts)\n\n* React, Vite, Cypress\n\n* ethers.js and viem\n\n* PostgreSQL\n\n* Vercel and AWS\n\n\n\nWhat we offer\n\n* A salary range of €80k to €120k\n\n* A negotiable token allocation\n\n* Contribute to a fully open-source project\n\n* Fully-remote work with flexible working hours\n\n* Look back and know you've helped build the future of web3 identity\n\n* Work together with folks with 8+ years of blockchain experience\n\n* Build relationships with top partner teams: Gnosis Pay, Aleph Zero, NEAR, Kilt and more\n\n\n \n\n#Salary and compensation\n
No salary data published by company so we estimated salary based on similar jobs related to Web3, React, Typescript, Golang and Backend jobs that are similar:\n\n
$60,000 — $105,000/year\n

<strong>👉 Please reference you found the job on Remote OK, this helps us get more companies to post here, thanks!</strong><br><br>
When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.

<strong>👉 Please reference you found the job on Remote OK, this helps us get more companies to post here, thanks!</strong><br><br>
When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>.

When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name.

<strong>👉 Please reference you found the job on Remote OK, this helps us get more companies to post here, thanks!</strong><br><br>
When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.

When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>.

<strong>👉 Please reference you found the job on Remote OK, this helps us get more companies to post here, thanks!</strong><br><br>
When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site.

Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter.

												When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.

Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter.

Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name.

When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>.

Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter.

<div class="markdown">\nOur mission is to unlock the collaborative power of communities by making Web3 universally easy to use, access, and build on.\n\nWorking with Consensys puts you at the forefront of an evolving paradigm, transforming our society for the better. We fundamentally believe blockchain is the next generation of technology that can lay the foundation for a more just and equitable society.&nbsp;\n\nBlockchain tech is just over 10 years old. Ethereum itself is still a toddler and we’re far from reaching our full potential. You’ll get to work on the tools, infrastructure, and apps that scale these platforms to billions of users.&nbsp;\n\nYou’ll be constantly exposed to new concepts, ideas, and frameworks from your peers, and as you work on different projects — challenging you to stay at the top of your game. You’ll join a network of entrepreneurs and technologists that reaches the edge of our ecosystem. Consensys alumni have moved on to become tech entrepreneurs, CEOs, and team leads at tech companies.\n\n\nAbout Infura\n\nInfura is the leading infrastructure platform providing scalable and easy-to-use APIs and cloud solutions for blockchain and decentralized application developers. Infura currently offers APIs for Ethereum, IPFS, and other leading decentralized networks, allowing developers to immediately begin building instead of spending time on architecting and maintaining their own infrastructure.\n\nInfura provides developers instant access to decentralized and blockchain networks without the need to sync or understand complicated peer to peer infrastructure. Similar to how one might access a cloud service to alleviate the friction of owning proprietary compute and storage, Infura lowers the barrier to entry for engineers to begin building.\n\nWe believe in a more equitable and decentralized future, and we know developers will be at the forefront of that progress. We want to empower developers to spend their time building, creating, and evolving by providing them with the best and easiest solution to their infrastructure needs.\n\nSome things to know about the Infura team, we are a remote first company, with team members all over the world. We strive to reduce meetings, respect work life balance, promote diversity, and generally be good people. We depend on each other not only to make an amazing product but to be a group that wants to succeed together.&nbsp;\n\n\nWhat you’ll do\n\nThe commercial platform team builds tools and platforms for monetizing and commercializing APIs and other developer offerings. Our commercial platform allows our product teams to rapidly build out support for offering public access and provides our customers with tools to understand and control their usage of those products. You will be developing tools and services within Kubernetes that allow us to easily stand up, operate, and monetize APIs at scale.\n\n\nWould be great if you brought this to the role\n\nYou have mastery over Golang or similar systems languages. You also have significant experience building with and operating service mesh / traffic routing proxies. You have solid experience with event-based systems and programming in cloud environments. You are knowledgeable about cloud based environments and understand things like object storage, databases (relational and NoSQL variants), and infrastructure management.\n\n\nDon't meet all the requirements? Don't sweat it. We’re passionate about building a diverse team of humans and as such, if you think you've got what it takes for our chaotic-but-fun, remote-friendly, start-up environment—apply anyway, detailing your relevant transferable skills in your cover letter. While we have a pretty good idea of what we need, we're ready for you to challenge our thinking on who needs to be in this role.\n\nConsensys is an equal opportunity employer. We encourage people from all backgrounds to apply. We are committed to ensuring that our technology is made available and accessible to everyone. All employment decisions are made without regard to race, color, national origin, ancestry, sex, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, age, genetic information, religion, disability, medical condition, pregnancy, marital status, family status, veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by law. Consensys is aware of fraudulent recruitment practices and we encourage all applicants to review our best practices to protect yourself which can be found (https://consensys.net/careers/best-practices-to-avoid-recruitment-fraud/). \n\n#Salary and compensation\n

When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.

<div class="markdown">\nWhat is the idOS? The idOS network is the decentralized, self-sovereign, compliant identity layer of web3. We make KYC credentials as movable as tokens, across different chains and ecosystems. We’re in production with a few select partners, and are currently pushing towards v1 just in time for the next mass adoption cycle. The core of idOS is a permissioned blockchain deployment (based on Kwil), running extensions (written in Golang) that connect to several blockchains (EVMs, NEAR, and more to come). We also develop a TypeScript SDK to make integration as effortless as possible. Some of our current tech challenges are:\n\n* expanding support across even more chains (more EVMs, Solana, etc)\n\n* making idOS even easier to understand and integrate, ideally by removing as many clicks and function calls as possible\n\n* deployment of novel encryption and zk tech towards bolstering user privacy and easing development experience\n\n\n\nRole and responsibilities\n\n* Build reliable and highly-available backend services for authentication, authorization, blockchain interaction, and indexing.\n\n* Build secure, upgradable smart contracts across several blockchain infrastructures.\n\n* Write reliable SDKs enabling developers to seamlessly interact with the idOS and provide users with a magical experience.\n\n* Contribute to our developer documentation and tooling to make idOS integration the smoothest developer experience in web3.\n\n* Create applications showing off the full potential of the idOS.\n\n* Drive idOS innovation by staying abreast of new trends, patterns, and tools we can use to keep our applications secure and on the bleeding edge.\n\n* Communicate effectively, clearly articulate ideas, and engage productively with us to help us make better decisions.\n\n* Clearly and frequently communicate progress and concerns in an actionable manner.\n\n* Work in a highly collaborative open source ecosystem, writing and reviewing understandable code we can be proud of.\n\n* Help our integrators succeed by helping them with integration architecture and technical support. Our success comes from their success.\n\n\n\nRequirements\n\n* You have 2+ years of professional experience with solidity and/or vyper.\n\n* You have 3+ years of professional experience with distributed systems (you know when to use ZeroMQ vs. Kafka vs. MQTT vs. NATS, etc).\n\n* You’re experienced in shipping production code, and dealing with very different load profiles. You’re comfortable architecting a solution for 1 rps to 1k rps, from a few MB to a lot of TB.\n\n* You’re comfortable in modern UNIX environments. You know how to use strace, lsof, cgroups, etc., and bash lines like find . -type f | xargs sed -i … don’t scare you.\n\n* You don’t shy away from frontend work. It’s ok if you can’t do SVG or animations, but you wouldn’t think twice about adding a new React Provider and passing some props around.\n\n* You have a natural tendency to write good code, but you also understand that “good code” is a matter of aesthetics, familiarity, and style.\n\n* You're able to work autonomously from research and speccing, to deployment and monitoring; you thrive in taking greater ownership and responsibility.\n\n* You are proactive and take action by default, consistently driving progress without asking for permission too much. You make others aware of how, when, where, and why you’re cowboying.\n\n* You know how to identify that a task is starting to overrun its original scope/budget, and know when to back off from rabbit holes.\n\n* You are fluent in spoken and written English. Remote comms are already hard enough.\n\n* You have experience using web3 apps and tools such as Uniswap, Aave, or MetaMask.\n\n* You are familiar with basic cryptography, and curious about harder cryptography.\n\n* You're somewhere within UTC±3.\n\n* You can provide a reference for a call.\n\n* You have experience building and documenting APIs, SDKs, and other developer-directed products. You’d be comfortable writing a draft for an EIP and work with community feedback.\n\n* You challenge people’s opinions and direction, but know the value of “disagree and commit”.\n\n* You're excited about blockchain technology, cryptoeconomics, game theory, and decentralization. It’s not about shitcoins, it’s about real products for real people.\n\n\n\nNice to have\n\n* Experience with identity and authentication tech helps a lot.

When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.

<strong>👉 Please reference you found the job on Remote OK, this helps us get more companies to post here, thanks!</strong><br><br>
When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.

When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.

When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site.

<strong>👉 Please reference you found the job on Remote OK, this helps us get more companies to post here, thanks!</strong><br><br>
When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site.

Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter.

<strong>👉 Please reference you found the job on Remote OK, this helps us get more companies to post here, thanks!</strong><br><br>
When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.

Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name.

Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name.

												<strong>👉 Please reference you found the job on Remote OK, this helps us get more companies to post here, thanks!</strong><br><br>
												When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.

<strong>👉 Please reference you found the job on Remote OK, this helps us get more companies to post here, thanks!</strong><br><br>
When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.

When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Consensys is hiring a </span><br>Remote Staff Backend Engineer Infura </h1>
<div class="markdown">\nOur mission is to unlock the collaborative power of communities by making Web3 universally easy to use, access, and build on.\n\nWorking with Consensys puts you at the forefront of an evolving paradigm, transforming our society for the better. We fundamentally believe blockchain is the next generation of technology that can lay the foundation for a more just and equitable society.&nbsp;\n\nBlockchain tech is just over 10 years old. Ethereum itself is still a toddler and we’re far from reaching our full potential. You’ll get to work on the tools, infrastructure, and apps that scale these platforms to billions of users.&nbsp;\n\nYou’ll be constantly exposed to new concepts, ideas, and frameworks from your peers, and as you work on different projects — challenging you to stay at the top of your game. You’ll join a network of entrepreneurs and technologists that reaches the edge of our ecosystem. Consensys alumni have moved on to become tech entrepreneurs, CEOs, and team leads at tech companies.\n\n\nAbout Infura\n\nInfura is the leading infrastructure platform providing scalable and easy-to-use APIs and cloud solutions for blockchain and decentralized application developers. Infura currently offers APIs for Ethereum, IPFS, and other leading decentralized networks, allowing developers to immediately begin building instead of spending time on architecting and maintaining their own infrastructure.\n\nInfura provides developers instant access to decentralized and blockchain networks without the need to sync or understand complicated peer to peer infrastructure. Similar to how one might access a cloud service to alleviate the friction of owning proprietary compute and storage, Infura lowers the barrier to entry for engineers to begin building.\n\nWe believe in a more equitable and decentralized future, and we know developers will be at the forefront of that progress. We want to empower developers to spend their time building, creating, and evolving by providing them with the best and easiest solution to their infrastructure needs.\n\nSome things to know about the Infura team, we are a remote first company, with team members all over the world. We strive to reduce meetings, respect work life balance, promote diversity, and generally be good people. We depend on each other not only to make an amazing product but to be a group that wants to succeed together.&nbsp;\n\n\nWhat you’ll do\n\nThe commercial platform team builds tools and platforms for monetizing and commercializing APIs and other developer offerings. Our commercial platform allows our product teams to rapidly build out support for offering public access and provides our customers with tools to understand and control their usage of those products. You will be developing tools and services within Kubernetes that allow us to easily stand up, operate, and monetize APIs at scale.\n\n\nWould be great if you brought this to the role\n\nYou have mastery over Golang or similar systems languages. You also have significant experience building with and operating service mesh / traffic routing proxies. You have solid experience with event-based systems and programming in cloud environments. You are knowledgeable about cloud based environments and understand things like object storage, databases (relational and NoSQL variants), and infrastructure management.\n\n\nDon't meet all the requirements? Don't sweat it. We’re passionate about building a diverse team of humans and as such, if you think you've got what it takes for our chaotic-but-fun, remote-friendly, start-up environment—apply anyway, detailing your relevant transferable skills in your cover letter. While we have a pretty good idea of what we need, we're ready for you to challenge our thinking on who needs to be in this role.\n\nConsensys is an equal opportunity employer. We encourage people from all backgrounds to apply. We are committed to ensuring that our technology is made available and accessible to everyone. All employment decisions are made without regard to race, color, national origin, ancestry, sex, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, age, genetic information, religion, disability, medical condition, pregnancy, marital status, family status, veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by law. Consensys is aware of fraudulent recruitment practices and we encourage all applicants to review our best practices to protect yourself which can be found (https://consensys.net/careers/best-practices-to-avoid-recruitment-fraud/). \n\n#Salary and compensation\n

When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">idOS is hiring a </span><br>Remote Backend Web3 Developer </h1>
<div class="markdown">\nWhat is the idOS? The idOS network is the decentralized, self-sovereign, compliant identity layer of web3. We make KYC credentials as movable as tokens, across different chains and ecosystems. We’re in production with a few select partners, and are currently pushing towards v1 just in time for the next mass adoption cycle. The core of idOS is a permissioned blockchain deployment (based on Kwil), running extensions (written in Golang) that connect to several blockchains (EVMs, NEAR, and more to come). We also develop a TypeScript SDK to make integration as effortless as possible. Some of our current tech challenges are:\n\n* expanding support across even more chains (more EVMs, Solana, etc)\n\n* making idOS even easier to understand and integrate, ideally by removing as many clicks and function calls as possible\n\n* deployment of novel encryption and zk tech towards bolstering user privacy and easing development experience\n\n\n\nRole and responsibilities\n\n* Build reliable and highly-available backend services for authentication, authorization, blockchain interaction, and indexing.\n\n* Build secure, upgradable smart contracts across several blockchain infrastructures.\n\n* Write reliable SDKs enabling developers to seamlessly interact with the idOS and provide users with a magical experience.\n\n* Contribute to our developer documentation and tooling to make idOS integration the smoothest developer experience in web3.\n\n* Create applications showing off the full potential of the idOS.\n\n* Drive idOS innovation by staying abreast of new trends, patterns, and tools we can use to keep our applications secure and on the bleeding edge.\n\n* Communicate effectively, clearly articulate ideas, and engage productively with us to help us make better decisions.\n\n* Clearly and frequently communicate progress and concerns in an actionable manner.\n\n* Work in a highly collaborative open source ecosystem, writing and reviewing understandable code we can be proud of.\n\n* Help our integrators succeed by helping them with integration architecture and technical support. Our success comes from their success.\n\n\n\nRequirements\n\n* You have 2+ years of professional experience with solidity and/or vyper.\n\n* You have 3+ years of professional experience with distributed systems (you know when to use ZeroMQ vs. Kafka vs. MQTT vs. NATS, etc).\n\n* You’re experienced in shipping production code, and dealing with very different load profiles. You’re comfortable architecting a solution for 1 rps to 1k rps, from a few MB to a lot of TB.\n\n* You’re comfortable in modern UNIX environments. You know how to use strace, lsof, cgroups, etc., and bash lines like find . -type f | xargs sed -i … don’t scare you.\n\n* You don’t shy away from frontend work. It’s ok if you can’t do SVG or animations, but you wouldn’t think twice about adding a new React Provider and passing some props around.\n\n* You have a natural tendency to write good code, but you also understand that “good code” is a matter of aesthetics, familiarity, and style.\n\n* You're able to work autonomously from research and speccing, to deployment and monitoring; you thrive in taking greater ownership and responsibility.\n\n* You are proactive and take action by default, consistently driving progress without asking for permission too much. You make others aware of how, when, where, and why you’re cowboying.\n\n* You know how to identify that a task is starting to overrun its original scope/budget, and know when to back off from rabbit holes.\n\n* You are fluent in spoken and written English. Remote comms are already hard enough.\n\n* You have experience using web3 apps and tools such as Uniswap, Aave, or MetaMask.\n\n* You are familiar with basic cryptography, and curious about harder cryptography.\n\n* You're somewhere within UTC±3.\n\n* You can provide a reference for a call.\n\n* You have experience building and documenting APIs, SDKs, and other developer-directed products. You’d be comfortable writing a draft for an EIP and work with community feedback.\n\n* You challenge people’s opinions and direction, but know the value of “disagree and commit”.\n\n* You're excited about blockchain technology, cryptoeconomics, game theory, and decentralization. It’s not about shitcoins, it’s about real products for real people.\n\n\n\nNice to have\n\n* Experience with identity and authentication tech helps a lot. OpenID, OAuth, WebAuthN, Passkeys, U2F, LDAP, SAML, etc; any of these will be useful.\n\n* Experience with non-EVM blockchains.\n\n* You know enough about Golang such that using ChatGPT doesn’t help you out a lot anymore.\n\n\n\nTechs we use\n\n* JavaScript/TypeScript (a lot; frontend and backend), Golang (a moderate amount, for chain extensions), Rust and Solidity (for smart contracts)\n\n* React, Vite, Cypress\n\n* ethers.js and viem\n\n* PostgreSQL\n\n* Vercel and AWS\n\n\n\nWhat we offer\n\n* A salary range of €80k to €120k\n\n* A negotiable token allocation\n\n* Contribute to a fully open-source project\n\n* Fully-remote work with flexible working hours\n\n* Look back and know you've helped build the future of web3 identity\n\n* Work together with folks with 8+ years of blockchain experience\n\n* Build relationships with top partner teams: Gnosis Pay, Aleph Zero, NEAR, Kilt and more\n\n\n \n\n#Salary and compensation\n
No salary data published by company so we estimated salary based on similar jobs related to Web3, React, Typescript, Golang and Backend jobs that are similar:\n\n
$60,000 — $105,000/year\n

When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>.

Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name.

<strong>👉 Please reference you found the job on Remote OK, this helps us get more companies to post here, thanks!</strong><br><br>
When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site.

When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.

<strong>👉 Please reference you found the job on Remote OK, this helps us get more companies to post here, thanks!</strong><br><br>
When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site.

When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>.

When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>.

Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name.

												<strong>👉 Please reference you found the job on Remote OK, this helps us get more companies to post here, thanks!</strong><br><br>
												When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.

<strong>👉 Please reference you found the job on Remote OK, this helps us get more companies to post here, thanks!</strong><br><br>
When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.

<div class="markdown">\nOur mission is to unlock the collaborative power of communities by making Web3 universally easy to use, access, and build on.\n\nWorking with Consensys puts you at the forefront of an evolving paradigm, transforming our society for the better. We fundamentally believe blockchain is the next generation of technology that can lay the foundation for a more just and equitable society.&nbsp;\n\nBlockchain tech is just over 10 years old. Ethereum itself is still a toddler and we’re far from reaching our full potential. You’ll get to work on the tools, infrastructure, and apps that scale these platforms to billions of users.&nbsp;\n\nYou’ll be constantly exposed to new concepts, ideas, and frameworks from your peers, and as you work on different projects — challenging you to stay at the top of your game. You’ll join a network of entrepreneurs and technologists that reaches the edge of our ecosystem. Consensys alumni have moved on to become tech entrepreneurs, CEOs, and team leads at tech companies.\n\n\nAbout Infura\n\nInfura is the leading infrastructure platform providing scalable and easy-to-use APIs and cloud solutions for blockchain and decentralized application developers. Infura currently offers APIs for Ethereum, IPFS, and other leading decentralized networks, allowing developers to immediately begin building instead of spending time on architecting and maintaining their own infrastructure.\n\nInfura provides developers instant access to decentralized and blockchain networks without the need to sync or understand complicated peer to peer infrastructure. Similar to how one might access a cloud service to alleviate the friction of owning proprietary compute and storage, Infura lowers the barrier to entry for engineers to begin building.\n\nWe believe in a more equitable and decentralized future, and we know developers will be at the forefront of that progress. We want to empower developers to spend their time building, creating, and evolving by providing them with the best and easiest solution to their infrastructure needs.\n\nSome things to know about the Infura team, we are a remote first company, with team members all over the world. We strive to reduce meetings, respect work life balance, promote diversity, and generally be good people. We depend on each other not only to make an amazing product but to be a group that wants to succeed together.&nbsp;\n\n\nWhat you’ll do\n\nThe commercial platform team builds tools and platforms for monetizing and commercializing APIs and other developer offerings. Our commercial platform allows our product teams to rapidly build out support for offering public access and provides our customers with tools to understand and control their usage of those products. You will be developing tools and services within Kubernetes that allow us to easily stand up, operate, and monetize APIs at scale.\n\n\nWould be great if you brought this to the role\n\nYou have mastery over Golang or similar systems languages. You also have significant experience building with and operating service mesh / traffic routing proxies. You have solid experience with event-based systems and programming in cloud environments. You are knowledgeable about cloud based environments and understand things like object storage, databases (relational and NoSQL variants), and infrastructure management.\n\n\nDon't meet all the requirements? Don't sweat it. We’re passionate about building a diverse team of humans and as such, if you think you've got what it takes for our chaotic-but-fun, remote-friendly, start-up environment—apply anyway, detailing your relevant transferable skills in your cover letter. While we have a pretty good idea of what we need, we're ready for you to challenge our thinking on who needs to be in this role.\n\nConsensys is an equal opportunity employer. We encourage people from all backgrounds to apply. We are committed to ensuring that our technology is made available and accessible to everyone. All employment decisions are made without regard to race, color, national origin, ancestry, sex, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, age, genetic information, religion, disability, medical condition, pregnancy, marital status, family status, veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by law. Consensys is aware of fraudulent recruitment practices and we encourage all applicants to review our best practices to protect yourself which can be found (https://consensys.net/careers/best-practices-to-avoid-recruitment-fraud/). \n\n#Salary and compensation\n

When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">idOS is hiring a </span><br>Remote Backend Web3 Developer </h1>
<div class="markdown">\nWhat is the idOS? The idOS network is the decentralized, self-sovereign, compliant identity layer of web3. We make KYC credentials as movable as tokens, across different chains and ecosystems. We’re in production with a few select partners, and are currently pushing towards v1 just in time for the next mass adoption cycle. The core of idOS is a permissioned blockchain deployment (based on Kwil), running extensions (written in Golang) that connect to several blockchains (EVMs, NEAR, and more to come). We also develop a TypeScript SDK to make integration as effortless as possible. Some of our current tech challenges are:\n\n* expanding support across even more chains (more EVMs, Solana, etc)\n\n* making idOS even easier to understand and integrate, ideally by removing as many clicks and function calls as possible\n\n* deployment of novel encryption and zk tech towards bolstering user privacy and easing development experience\n\n\n\nRole and responsibilities\n\n* Build reliable and highly-available backend services for authentication, authorization, blockchain interaction, and indexing.\n\n* Build secure, upgradable smart contracts across several blockchain infrastructures.\n\n* Write reliable SDKs enabling developers to seamlessly interact with the idOS and provide users with a magical experience.\n\n* Contribute to our developer documentation and tooling to make idOS integration the smoothest developer experience in web3.\n\n* Create applications showing off the full potential of the idOS.\n\n* Drive idOS innovation by staying abreast of new trends, patterns, and tools we can use to keep our applications secure and on the bleeding edge.\n\n* Communicate effectively, clearly articulate ideas, and engage productively with us to help us make better decisions.\n\n* Clearly and frequently communicate progress and concerns in an actionable manner.\n\n* Work in a highly collaborative open source ecosystem, writing and reviewing understandable code we can be proud of.\n\n* Help our integrators succeed by helping them with integration architecture and technical support. Our success comes from their success.\n\n\n\nRequirements\n\n* You have 2+ years of professional experience with solidity and/or vyper.\n\n* You have 3+ years of professional experience with distributed systems (you know when to use ZeroMQ vs. Kafka vs. MQTT vs. NATS, etc).\n\n* You’re experienced in shipping production code, and dealing with very different load profiles. You’re comfortable architecting a solution for 1 rps to 1k rps, from a few MB to a lot of TB.\n\n* You’re comfortable in modern UNIX environments. You know how to use strace, lsof, cgroups, etc., and bash lines like find . -type f | xargs sed -i … don’t scare you.\n\n* You don’t shy away from frontend work. It’s ok if you can’t do SVG or animations, but you wouldn’t think twice about adding a new React Provider and passing some props around.\n\n* You have a natural tendency to write good code, but you also understand that “good code” is a matter of aesthetics, familiarity, and style.\n\n* You're able to work autonomously from research and speccing, to deployment and monitoring; you thrive in taking greater ownership and responsibility.\n\n* You are proactive and take action by default, consistently driving progress without asking for permission too much. You make others aware of how, when, where, and why you’re cowboying.\n\n* You know how to identify that a task is starting to overrun its original scope/budget, and know when to back off from rabbit holes.\n\n* You are fluent in spoken and written English. Remote comms are already hard enough.\n\n* You have experience using web3 apps and tools such as Uniswap, Aave, or MetaMask.\n\n* You are familiar with basic cryptography, and curious about harder cryptography.\n\n* You're somewhere within UTC±3.\n\n* You can provide a reference for a call.\n\n* You have experience building and documenting APIs, SDKs, and other developer-directed products. You’d be comfortable writing a draft for an EIP and work with community feedback.\n\n* You challenge people’s opinions and direction, but know the value of “disagree and commit”.\n\n* You're excited about blockchain technology, cryptoeconomics, game theory, and decentralization. It’s not about shitcoins, it’s about real products for real people.\n\n\n\nNice to have\n\n* Experience with identity and authentication tech helps a lot. OpenID, OAuth, WebAuthN, Passkeys, U2F, LDAP, SAML, etc; any of these will be useful.\n\n* Experience with non-EVM blockchains.\n\n* You know enough about Golang such that using ChatGPT doesn’t help you out a lot anymore.\n\n\n\nTechs we use\n\n* JavaScript/TypeScript (a lot; frontend and backend), Golang (a moderate amount, for chain extensions), Rust and Solidity (for smart contracts)\n\n* React, Vite, Cypress\n\n* ethers.js and viem\n\n* PostgreSQL\n\n* Vercel and AWS\n\n\n\nWhat we offer\n\n* A salary range of €80k to €120k\n\n* A negotiable token allocation\n\n* Contribute to a fully open-source project\n\n* Fully-remote work with flexible working hours\n\n* Look back and know you've helped build the future of web3 identity\n\n* Work together with folks with 8+ years of blockchain experience\n\n* Build relationships with top partner teams: Gnosis Pay, Aleph Zero, NEAR, Kilt and more\n\n\n \n\n#Salary and compensation\n
No salary data published by company so we estimated salary based on similar jobs related to Web3, React, Typescript, Golang and Backend jobs that are similar:\n\n
$60,000 — $105,000/year\n

<strong>👉 Please reference you found the job on Remote OK, this helps us get more companies to post here, thanks!</strong><br><br>
When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.

<strong>👉 Please reference you found the job on Remote OK, this helps us get more companies to post here, thanks!</strong><br><br>
When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.

When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.

<strong>👉 Please reference you found the job on Remote OK, this helps us get more companies to post here, thanks!</strong><br><br>
When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.

When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.

<strong>👉 Please reference you found the job on Remote OK, this helps us get more companies to post here, thanks!</strong><br><br>
When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>.

When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>.

												<strong>👉 Please reference you found the job on Remote OK, this helps us get more companies to post here, thanks!</strong><br><br>
												When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.

												When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.

												When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter.

When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site.

We fundamentally believe blockchain is the next generation of technology that can lay the foundation for a more just and equitable society.&nbsp;\n\nBlockchain tech is just over 10 years old. Ethereum itself is still a toddler and we’re far from reaching our full potential. You’ll get to work on the tools, infrastructure, and apps that scale these platforms to billions of users.&nbsp;\n\nYou’ll be constantly exposed to new concepts, ideas, and frameworks from your peers, and as you work on different projects — challenging you to stay at the top of your game. You’ll join a network of entrepreneurs and technologists that reaches the edge of our ecosystem. Consensys alumni have moved on to become tech entrepreneurs, CEOs, and team leads at tech companies.\n\n\nAbout Infura\n\nInfura is the leading infrastructure platform providing scalable and easy-to-use APIs and cloud solutions for blockchain and decentralized application developers. Infura currently offers APIs for Ethereum, IPFS, and other leading decentralized networks, allowing developers to immediately begin building instead of spending time on architecting and maintaining their own infrastructure.\n\nInfura provides developers instant access to decentralized and blockchain networks without the need to sync or understand complicated peer to peer infrastructure. Similar to how one might access a cloud service to alleviate the friction of owning proprietary compute and storage, Infura lowers the barrier to entry for engineers to begin building.\n\nWe believe in a more equitable and decentralized future, and we know developers will be at the forefront of that progress. We want to empower developers to spend their time building, creating, and evolving by providing them with the best and easiest solution to their infrastructure needs.\n\nSome things to know about the Infura team, we are a remote first company, with team members all over the world. We strive to reduce meetings, respect work life balance, promote diversity, and generally be good people. We depend on each other not only to make an amazing product but to be a group that wants to succeed together.&nbsp;\n\n\nWhat you’ll do\n\nThe commercial platform team builds tools and platforms for monetizing and commercializing APIs and other developer offerings. Our commercial platform allows our product teams to rapidly build out support for offering public access and provides our customers with tools to understand and control their usage of those products. You will be developing tools and services within Kubernetes that allow us to easily stand up, operate, and monetize APIs at scale.\n\n\nWould be great if you brought this to the role\n\nYou have mastery over Golang or similar systems languages. You also have significant experience building with and operating service mesh / traffic routing proxies. You have solid experience with event-based systems and programming in cloud environments. You are knowledgeable about cloud based environments and understand things like object storage, databases (relational and NoSQL variants), and infrastructure management.\n\n\nDon't meet all the requirements? Don't sweat it. We’re passionate about building a diverse team of humans and as such, if you think you've got what it takes for our chaotic-but-fun, remote-friendly, start-up environment—apply anyway, detailing your relevant transferable skills in your cover letter. While we have a pretty good idea of what we need, we're ready for you to challenge our thinking on who needs to be in this role.\n\nConsensys is an equal opportunity employer. We encourage people from all backgrounds to apply. We are committed to ensuring that our technology is made available and accessible to everyone. All employment decisions are made without regard to race, color, national origin, ancestry, sex, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, age, genetic information, religion, disability, medical condition, pregnancy, marital status, family status, veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by law.

When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site.

The core of idOS is a permissioned blockchain deployment (based on Kwil), running extensions (written in Golang) that connect to several blockchains (EVMs, NEAR, and more to come).

Some of our current tech challenges are:\n\n* expanding support across even more chains (more EVMs, Solana, etc)\n\n* making idOS even easier to understand and integrate, ideally by removing as many clicks and function calls as possible\n\n* deployment of novel encryption and zk tech towards bolstering user privacy and easing development experience\n\n\n\nRole and responsibilities\n\n* Build reliable and highly-available backend services for authentication, authorization, blockchain interaction, and indexing.\n\n* Build secure, upgradable smart contracts across several blockchain infrastructures.\n\n* Write reliable SDKs enabling developers to seamlessly interact with the idOS and provide users with a magical experience.\n\n* Contribute to our developer documentation and tooling to make idOS integration the smoothest developer experience in web3.\n\n* Create applications showing off the full potential of the idOS.\n\n* Drive idOS innovation by staying abreast of new trends, patterns, and tools we can use to keep our applications secure and on the bleeding edge.\n\n* Communicate effectively, clearly articulate ideas, and engage productively with us to help us make better decisions.\n\n* Clearly and frequently communicate progress and concerns in an actionable manner.\n\n* Work in a highly collaborative open source ecosystem, writing and reviewing understandable code we can be proud of.\n\n* Help our integrators succeed by helping them with integration architecture and technical support. Our success comes from their success.\n\n\n\nRequirements\n\n* You have 2+ years of professional experience with solidity and/or vyper.\n\n* You have 3+ years of professional experience with distributed systems (you know when to use ZeroMQ vs. Kafka vs. MQTT vs. NATS, etc).\n\n* You’re experienced in shipping production code, and dealing with very different load profiles. You’re comfortable architecting a solution for 1 rps to 1k rps, from a few MB to a lot of TB.\n\n* You’re comfortable in modern UNIX environments. You know how to use strace, lsof, cgroups, etc., and bash lines like find . -type f | xargs sed -i … don’t scare you.\n\n* You don’t shy away from frontend work. It’s ok if you can’t do SVG or animations, but you wouldn’t think twice about adding a new React Provider and passing some props around.\n\n* You have a natural tendency to write good code, but you also understand that “good code” is a matter of aesthetics, familiarity, and style.\n\n* You're able to work autonomously from research and speccing, to deployment and monitoring; you thrive in taking greater ownership and responsibility.\n\n* You are proactive and take action by default, consistently driving progress without asking for permission too much. You make others aware of how, when, where, and why you’re cowboying.\n\n* You know how to identify that a task is starting to overrun its original scope/budget, and know when to back off from rabbit holes.\n\n* You are fluent in spoken and written English. Remote comms are already hard enough.\n\n* You have experience using web3 apps and tools such as Uniswap, Aave, or MetaMask.\n\n* You are familiar with basic cryptography, and curious about harder cryptography.\n\n* You're somewhere within UTC±3.\n\n* You can provide a reference for a call.\n\n* You have experience building and documenting APIs, SDKs, and other developer-directed products. You’d be comfortable writing a draft for an EIP and work with community feedback.\n\n* You challenge people’s opinions and direction, but know the value of “disagree and commit”.\n\n* You're excited about blockchain technology, cryptoeconomics, game theory, and decentralization. It’s not about shitcoins, it’s about real products for real people.\n\n\n\nNice to have\n\n* Experience with identity and authentication tech helps a lot. OpenID, OAuth, WebAuthN, Passkeys, U2F, LDAP, SAML, etc; any of these will be useful.\n\n* Experience with non-EVM blockchains.\n\n* You know enough about Golang such that using ChatGPT doesn’t help you out a lot anymore.\n\n\n\nTechs we use\n\n* JavaScript/TypeScript (a lot; frontend and backend), Golang (a moderate amount, for chain extensions), Rust and Solidity (for smart contracts)\n\n* React, Vite, Cypress\n\n* ethers.js and viem\n\n* PostgreSQL\n\n* Vercel and AWS\n\n\n\nWhat we offer\n\n* A salary range of €80k to €120k\n\n* A negotiable token allocation\n\n* Contribute to a fully open-source project\n\n* Fully-remote work with flexible working hours\n\n* Look back and know you've helped build the future of web3 identity\n\n* Work together with folks with 8+ years of blockchain experience\n\n* Build relationships with top partner teams: Gnosis Pay, Aleph Zero, NEAR, Kilt and more\n\n\n \n\n#Salary and compensation\n

When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them.

Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter.

<strong>👉 Please reference you found the job on Remote OK, this helps us get more companies to post here, thanks!</strong><br><br>
When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.

<strong>👉 Please reference you found the job on Remote OK, this helps us get more companies to post here, thanks!</strong><br><br>
When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.

When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>.

When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>.

Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name.

Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter.

												When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>.

												When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site.
